    "content": "Watch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  August 2, 2024 / 1:54 PM EDT\n          / CBS News\n        \nUpdate: The Democratic Party announced on Friday, Aug 2., that Kamala Harris has received enough delegate votes to secure the presidential nomination. Read more here.\nDemocratic Party\u00a0delegates began voting in a virtual roll call on Thursday morning, Aug. 1, to select their new nominee, part of the process to formally elevate Vice President Kamala Harris to the top of the ticket for November. Harris is running unopposed, since no other candidate met the requirements to qualify. Here's more on what it means and how the vote will work:\nThe nearly 4,000 pledged delegates allocated during the Democratic primary process will be voting on the nomination.\nThe vast majority of the party's delegates were pledged to President Biden before he dropped out and endorsed Harris. These delegates weren't automatically assigned to Harris, but within the 48 hours of her campaign launch, an overwhelming majority of the delegates said they would back her.\u00a0\nUnder DNC rules, Harris' presidential campaign \u2014 and anyone seeking to challenge her \u2014 had to file paperwork with the DNC and obtain digital signatures from at least 300 delegates, with no more than 50 from a single state, by July 30 at 6 p.m. ET.\nNo challenger met that threshold to contest Harris' nomination; instead, the most likely figures quickly backed her nomination. At this point, she is the presumptive nominee, and the vote is largely ceremonial.\nIn the days since Mr. Biden dropped out and endorsed her, Harris has won endorsements from more than 3,000 of the 4,000 pledged delegates. She ended up with 3,923 delegate signatures during the qualifying period. The number of delegate votes she needs in the virtual roll call to secure the nomination is 1,976.\u00a0\nThe committee's rules established that if only one candidate qualified, the party would hold a roll call vote virtually as soon as Aug. 1 \u2014 not in person at its mid-August convention in Chicago.\u00a0\nParty leaders announced Tuesday night that delegates would be able to vote electronically beginning at 9 a.m. ET on Thursday, Aug. 1. The voting will conclude at 6 p.m. ET on Monday, Aug. 5.\nDelegates are voting through an online platform run by the DNC, using a personalized and watermarked form sent over email. They can either send the form back or have the DNC call them to cast their vote. Ballots are being sent on a rolling basis, and the process is expected to take several days. Once the votes are in, the DNC will tally them and share the full results after the roll call is closed.\u00a0\n\"Each roll call form has a range of security features to establish the authenticity and accuracy of each vote. Clear instructions and technical support will be provided to delegates,\" the DNC has said.\u00a0\nThe process for the virtual roll call and the gathering of delegate signatures largely mirrors the process used in 2020, during the pandemic.\nAutomatic delegates or \"superdelegates,\" such as Democratic governors, members of Congress and former presidents, also have a vote in the signature threshold and the roll call process. The DNC says because Harris got the verified support of a majority of pledged delegates, the votes of both pledged delegates and superdelegates will count on the first ballot of the virtual roll call. \u00a0\nThe DNC said it will share the full results of the roll call after it is completed, but it's unclear when or whether they will make an announcement once Harris passes the threshold needed to secure a majority of delegates.\nWhile the DNC has said that option is possible, the vice presidential candidate does not have to be nominated at the same time as the presidential nominee. Harris must pick a running mate by Aug. 7 to comply with Ohio's current ballot deadline, which remains in effect. Harris' team is planning to finish the vetting of the VP field and expects her to pick her running mate by Aug. 5, sources familiar with the process say.\nSometime after Harris makes her pick, Moore will declare her choice the nominee. There is no separate vote on the vice presidential pick. At the in-person convention in Chicago, there will be ceremonial votes for Harris and her running mate, but the ticket will have been established by then.\nIn May, the DNC made a push for a virtual process because of Ohio's Aug. 7 deadline for major parties to submit the names of their certified candidates for the November ballot.\u00a0\nWhile Ohio Republicans passed a law to push that deadline to Sept. 1, it will not go into effect until then. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, says Ohio would honor that Sept. 1 deadline. But the DNC and members say the possibility of legal challenges by other outside groups, such as the conservative Heritage Foundation, creates unnecessary risk.\u00a0\n\"If we take chances with state processes and deadlines, Republican groups could make the argument to challenge Democratic votes on the post-election side, arguing that our nominee should never have been on the ballot in the first place,\" said DNC outside counsel Pat Moore.\u00a0\nAaron Navarro is a CBS News digital reporter covering the 2024 elections.

She reached that marker at warp speed, with an Associated Press survey of delegates nationwide showing she locked down the necessary commitments a mere 32 hours after Biden\u2019s announcement.\nHarris\u2019 nomination became official after a five-day round of online balloting by Democratic National Convention delegates ended Monday night, with the party saying in a statement released just before midnight that 99% of delegates casting ballots had done so for Harris. The party had long contemplated the early virtual roll call to ensure Biden would appear on the ballot in every state. It said it would next formally certify the vote before holding a celebratory roll call at the party\u2019s convention later this month in Chicago.\nAn Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted after Biden withdrew found 46% of Americans have a favorable view of Harris, while a nearly identical share has an unfavorable view of her. But more Democrats say they are satisfied with her candidacy compared with that of Biden, energizing a party that had long been resigned to the 81-year-old Biden being its nominee against former President Donald Trump, a Republican they view as an existential threat.\n\n\nAlready Harris has telegraphed that she doesn\u2019t plan to veer much from the themes and policies that framed Biden\u2019s candidacy, such as democracy, gun violence prevention and abortion rights. But her delivery can be far fierier, particularly when she invokes her prosecutorial background to lambast Trump and his 34 felony convictions for falsifying business records in connection with a hush money scheme.\n\u201cGiven that unique voice of a new generation, of a prosecutor and a woman when fundamental rights, especially reproductive rights, are on the line, it\u2019s almost as if the stars have aligned for her at this moment in history,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California, who was tapped to succeed Harris in the Senate when she became vice president.\n\n\nKamala Devi Harris was born Oct. 20, 1964, in Oakland, California, to Shyamala Gopalan, a breast cancer scientist who emigrated to the United States from India when she was 19 years old, and Stanford University emeritus professor Donald Harris, a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Jamaica. Her parents\u2019 advocacy for civil rights gave her what she described as a \u201cstroller\u2019s-eye view\u201d of the movement.\nShe spent years as a prosecutor in the Bay Area before her elevation as the state\u2019s attorney general in 2010 and then election as U.S. senator in 2016.\nHarris was sworn in as San Francisco\u2019s district attorney with her mother Dr. Shyamala Gopalan holding a copy of The Bill of Rights in January 2004. AP Photo/George Nikitin, File)\n\nHarris arrived in Washington as a senator at the dawn of the volatile Trump era, quickly establishing herself as a reliable liberal opponent of the new president\u2019s personnel and policies and fanning speculation about a presidential bid of her own. Securing a spot on the coveted Judiciary Committee gave her a national spotlight to interrogate prominent Trump nominees, such as now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\u201cI\u2019m not able to be rushed this fast,\u201d then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions said during a 2017 hearing as Harris repeatedly pressed him on potential conversations with Russian nationals. \u201cIt makes me nervous.\u201d\n Harris questions Sessions as he testifies before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on June 13, 2017. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File)\n\nHarris launched her 2020 presidential campaign with much promise, drawing parallels to former President Barack Obama and attracting more than 20,000 people to a kickoff rally in her hometown. But Harris withdrew from the primary race before the first nominating contest in Iowa, plagued by staff dissent that spilled out into the open and an inability to attract enough campaign cash.\nHarris struggled to deliver a consistent pitch to Democratic voters and wobbled on key issues such as health care. She suggested she backed eliminating private insurance for a full government-run system \u2014 \u201cMedicare for All\u201d coverage \u2014 before releasing her own health care plan that preserved private insurance. Now, during her nascent general election campaign, Harris has already reversed some of her earlier, more liberal positions, such as a ban on fracking that she endorsed in 2019.\nAnd while Harris tried to deploy her law enforcement background as an asset in her 2020 presidential campaign, it never attracted enough support in a party that couldn\u2019t reconcile some of her past tough-on-crime positions at a time of heightened focus on police brutality.\n\n\nStill, Harris was at the top of the vice presidential shortlist when Biden was pondering his running mate, after his pledge in early 2020 that he would choose a Black woman as his No. 2. He was fond of Harris, who had forged a close friendship with his now-deceased son Beau, who had been Delaware\u2019s attorney general when she was in that job for California.\nHer first months as vice president were far from smooth. Biden asked her to lead the administration\u2019s diplomatic efforts with Central America on the root causes of migration to the United States, which triggered attacks from Republicans on border security and remains a political vulnerability. It didn\u2019t help matters that Harris stumbled in big interviews, such as in a 2021 sit-down with NBC News\u2019 Lester Holt when she responded dismissively that \u201cI haven\u2019t been to Europe\u201d when the anchor noted that she hadn\u2019t visited the U.S.-Mexico border.\nPresident Joe Biden walks with Harris in the Rose Garden of the White House, May 13, 2021, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)\n\nFor her first two years, Harris also was often tethered to Washington so she could break tie votes in the evenly divided Senate, which gave Democrats landmark wins on the climate and health care but also constrained opportunities for her to travel around the country and meet voters.\nHer visibility became far more prominent after the 2022 Supreme Court ruling that dismantled Roe v. Wade, as she became the chief spokesperson for the administration on abortion rights and was a more natural messenger than Biden, a lifelong Catholic who had in the past favored restrictions on the procedure. She is the first vice president to tour an abortion clinic and speaks about reproductive rights in the broader context of maternal health, especially for Black women.\nThroughout her vice presidency, Harris has been careful to remain loyal to Biden while emphasizing that she would be ready to step in if needed. That dramatic transition began in late June after the first debate between Biden and Trump, where the president\u2019s stumbles were so cataclysmic that he could never reverse the loss of confidence from other Democrats.\n\n\nAfter Biden ended his candidacy July 21, he quickly endorsed Harris. And during the first two weeks of her 2024 presidential bid, enthusiasm among the Democratic base surged, with donations pouring in, scores of volunteers showing up at field offices and supporters swelling so much in numbers that event organizers have had to swap venues. \nThe Harris campaign now believes it has a renewed opportunity to compete in Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia \u2014 states that Biden had started to abandon in favor of shoring up the so-called \u201cblue wall\u201d states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. \n\u201cThe country is able to see the Kamala Harris that we all know,\u201d said Bakari Sellers, who was a national co-chair of her 2020 campaign. \u201cWe really didn\u2019t allow the country to see her\u201d four years ago. Sellers said: \u201cWe had her in bubble wrap. What people are seeing now is that she\u2019s real, she\u2019s talented.\u201d\nHarris speaks during a campaign rally, July 30, 2024, in Atlanta. (AP Photo/John Bazemore, File)\n\nYet Democrats are anticipating that Harris\u2019 political honeymoon will wear off, and she is inevitably going to come under tougher scrutiny for Biden administration positions, the state of the economy and volatile situations abroad, particularly in the Middle East. Harris has also yet to answer extended questions from journalists nor sit down for a formal interview since she began her run.\nThe Trump campaign has been eager to define Harris as she continues to introduce herself to voters nationwide, releasing an ad blaming her for the high number of illegal crossings at the southern border during the Biden administration and dubbing her \u201cFailed. Weak. Dangerously liberal.\u201d \nThe Republican nominee\u2019s supporters have also derisively branded Harris as a diversity hire, while Trump himself has engaged in ugly racial attacks of his own, wrongly asserting that Harris had in the past only promoted her Indian heritage and only recently played up her Black identity.\nHis remarks are previewing a season of racist and sexist claims against the person who would be the first woman and the first person of South Asian heritage in the presidency.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black,\u201d Trump said while addressing the annual convention of the National Association of Black Journalists. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t know, is she Indian or is she Black?\u201d \nIn her response, Harris called it \u201cthe same old show \u2014 the divisiveness and the disrespect\u201d and said voters \u201cdeserve better.\u201d \n\u201cThe American people deserve a leader who tells the truth, a leader who does not respond with hostility and anger when confronted with the facts,\u201d Harris said at a Sigma Gamma Rho sorority gathering in Houston. \u201cWe deserve a leader who understands that our differences do not divide us.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Instead of voting for her, however, in a virtual meeting this past Sunday, 29 uncommitted delegates voted in a way to honor their commitments \u201cto push for a nominee who will support an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza and an arms embargo on Israel\u2019s war and occupation against Palestinians.\u201d\n\u201cDelegates cast their votes for children, medical workers, journalists, families, and other civilians killed in Gaza,\u201d Doten wrote in the post.\nNever miss the news and analysis you care about.\nUncommitted delegates from Hawaii, Michigan, Minnesota, Kentucky, Missouri, New Jersey, Washington and Rhode Island were featured in the video of the meeting.\nAlthough none of the individuals they nominated to be president would lawfully be allowed to run for the office, their votes were deeply symbolic, highlighting the deaths that have occurred in Gaza since last fall. Many of the speakers were visibly emotional, holding back tears as they spoke.\n\u201cI cast my ballot today for Mohammed Gamal Al-Haddad, who was murdered by Israel on November 17, 2023,\u201d said Fatima Abed, an uncommitted delegate from Hawaii, who explained in her vote that Al-Haddad, who was 30 years old, was killed by an Israeli missile.\nRima Mohammad, an uncommitted delegate from Michigan, committed her vote to Hind Rajab, who was killed by Israel\u2019s military in January of this year.\n\u201cHind was a child only six years old, as old as my own child, promised safe passage with the Palestinian Red Crescent Society,\u201d Mohammad said in her voting statement. \u201cHer car was shot 335 times. The ambulance she called was hit by a tank using American missiles. Her body was found decomposing 12 days after she was supposed to have found safe passage.\u201d\nNew Jersey delegate Ahmad Awad cast his ballot for 14-year-old Abdul Rahman Manhal, saying:\nAbdul Rahman was a child full of joy and playfulness, who lived a life of fun and adventure. Abdul Rahman was murdered by the Israeli army on November 5, 2023, after sustaining extensive burns to his body from an Israeli airstrike.\nThe delegates also took the opportunity to discuss their greater aims, including Asma Mohammed, a delegate from Minnesota, who said that the delegates were seeking a meeting with Harris to convince her to change her views on continuing to allow the United States to provide material and financial support for Israel\u2019s genocidal killings.\n\u201cThese names are not just symbolic \u2014 they are showing that we cannot commit to this candidate without real change,\u201d Mohammed said in the video.\nAbbas Alawieh, an uncommitted delegate from Michigan, closed the meeting by reminding those watching why they had chosen to cast symbolic votes for Palestinian victims of Israel\u2019s war on Gaza instead of for Harris or any other Democratic Party option.\n\u201cWe have an obligation to speak their names, together, to make sure we\u2019re honoring their memories, and that in their memories we prevent any more killing using U.S. taxpayer funds and bombs,\u201d Alawieh said.\nLargely due to support for her beforehand as Joe Biden\u2019s vice presidential running mate, Harris was quick to secure presumptive nominee status shortly after the incumbent president dropped out of the race. At the conclusion of the virtual roll call vote on Monday, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced that Harris was the official nominee.\nThe roll call vote, happening weeks before the party\u2019s convention in Chicago, was deemed necessary in order to ensure Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, would appear on some states\u2019 ballots, as the deadlines for having their names submitted occur before the convention.\nHarris received around 99 percent of the delegates\u2019 votes, according to DNC officials.\n\u201cVice President Harris has historic momentum at her back as we embark on the final steps in officially certifying her as our Party\u2019s nominee,\u201d a joint statement from DNC Chair Jaime Harrison and DNC Convention Chair Minyon Moore read.\nFor several weeks since Biden\u2019s dropping out, Palestinian solidarity activists have expressed skepticism over Harris, and have urged her to take a more forceful stance against Israel, as well as to commit the U.S. to ending its support of that country and its continued genocidal attacks.\n\u201cFor months, we\u2019ve warned that Biden\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza would hurt his electability. Now, it\u2019s crucial for Vice President Harris to take a clear stance against weapons for Israel\u2019s war and occupation against Palestinians,\u201d read a statement from the Uncommitted National Movement in July.\nTruthout is funded almost entirely by readers \u2014 that\u2019s why we can speak truth to power and cut against the mainstream narrative.

    "publish_date": null,
    "content": "Vice President Harris has chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) to be her running mate as she heads toward a November faceoff against former President Trump, she announced Tuesday.\n Harris announced her choice of Walz in a post on Instagram and in a text message to supporters, praising his support for middle class families and his personal history serving in the National Guard and working as a teacher. \n “I share this background both because it’s impressive in its own right, and because you see in no uncertain terms how it informs his record,” Harris wrote on Instagram.\n “But what impressed me most about Tim is his deep commitment to his family: Gwen, Gus, and Hope,” she added, referencing Walz’s wife and children. “Doug and I look forward to working with him and Gwen to build an administration that reflects our shared values.”\n “We are going to build a great partnership,” Harris wrote. “We are going to build a great team. We are going to win this election.”\n Walz, 60, emerged as a dark horse contender for the No. 2 slot as chatter over other high-profile names, in particular Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly (D), dominated the early portion of the veepstakes.\n But the Minnesota governor saw his profile rise considerably over the past week, especially after a viral cable news interview in which he derided some Republicans as “weird” — a line of attack later adopted by national Democrats.\n His selection concludes a whirlwind two-week period that saw President Biden end his reelection bid, Harris consolidate support within the party to become the presumptive nominee, and the vice president’s team rapidly vet contenders to join her on the ticket in November.\n The pick drew praise from both progressive and more moderate Democrats.\n “Vice President Harris made an excellent decision in Gov. Walz as her running mate,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) posted on the social platform X. “Together, they will govern effectively, inclusively, and boldly for the American people. They won’t back down under tight odds, either – from healthcare to school lunch.”\n Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), who was the first House Democrat to call for Biden to step aside, called Walz a “solid, decent former colleague with good humor, a former teacher and veteran, who represented a Minnesota district usually represented by the GOP.”\n “You can’t not get along with no-nonsense Tim,” Doggett posted on X. “As Governor, he offers a straight-talking, compassionate leader delivering the progress we need.”\n Harris had not made up her mind on a running mate as of Monday night, taking the decision up until the final hours.\n Walz was also seen by many as a safer choice for Harris thanks to his liberal bona fides and the fact that some of the other contenders had come under fire from certain segments of the left. Shapiro received heavy scrutiny recently over his response to pro-Palestinian protests that emerged in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war, and both he and Kelly drew the ire of union leaders.\n Adding to Walz’s appeal is the fact that he hails from a Midwestern state that Trump has increasingly set his sights on flipping. Though Biden won Minnesota in 2020 by 7 points, and no Republican has won the presidential race there in more than 50 years, Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance (R), have stepped up their efforts to campaign in the state.\n But he is not without vulnerabilities. Republicans are likely to use some of his policy positions on abortion and LGBTQ issues to paint him as a radical liberal, just as they have with Harris.\n Walz was governor of Minnesota during the riots that followed the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, and Republicans are certain to highlight images of that tumultuous time. The Trump campaign had previously attacked Harris for promoting a bail fund for demonstrators arrested in Minnesota following Floyd’s death.\n “It’s no surprise that San Francisco Liberal Kamala Harris wants West Coast wannabe Tim Walz as her running-mate – Walz has spent his governorship trying to reshape Minnesota in the image of the Golden State,” Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \n “From proposing his own carbon-free agenda, to suggesting stricter emission standards for gas-powered cars, and embracing policies to allow convicted felons to vote, Walz is obsessed with spreading California’s dangerously liberal agenda far and wide,” she added. “If Walz won’t tell voters the truth, we will: just like Kamala Harris, Tim Walz is a dangerously liberal extremist, and the Harris-Walz California dream is every American’s nightmare.”\n Harris and Walz will storm battleground states this week, starting Tuesday evening in Philadelphia. The two will travel later this week to Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada. Planned trips to North Carolina and Georgia were reportedly postponed as Hurricane Debby made landfall in the Southeast."

    "publish_date": null,
    "content": "Vice President Harris and her newly announced running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, were officially certified as the Democratic nominees for president and vice president, respectively, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced Tuesday. The certification, conducted by convention Secretary Jason Rae, comes less than a day after Harris formally secured the Democratic presidential nomination in a virtual roll call vote and just hours since she announced Walz would join her on the ticket. “It is my great honor and privilege to congratulate the Democratic Party’s official nominees for President and Vice President, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. A Harris-Walz ticket represents the future of the Democratic Party and our country,” DNC Chair Jaime Harrison said in a statement. It follows a nearly weeklong virtual voting period in which Harris received 99 percent of the votes of all delegates who participated. The vice president was the only candidate whose name was in contention following President Biden’s withdrawal from the race last month. Harris quickly shored up Democratic support after Biden exited the race, with a majority of delegates publicly declaring support for her by the end of her first full day of her campaign. The DNC originally planned to have the virtual roll call ahead of the Aug. 19 convention to ensure its nominee appears on the ballot in all 50 states after Democrats were notified earlier this year that their convention date didn’t meet an earlier Ohio deadline to certify the party’s presidential nominee. However, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) in June signed legislation to extend the deadline from Aug. 7 to Aug. 31. The DNC last month confirmed it would still move forward with the virtual roll call to ensure it has a presidential nominee by Aug. 7. Since launching her presidential bid, Harris has seen an uptick in the polls, narrowing the gap with former President Trump, and even slightly leading in some cases. Harris and Walz appeared together on the campaign trail Tuesday night for a rally in Philadelphia. The Harris campaign said it raised more than $20 million since announcing Walz as Harris’s running mate choice."

    "content": "The Biden ballot fix bill and a foreign money bill now head to Gov. DeWine.\nTwenty-three Ohio Senate Republicans joined Democrats on Friday during a special legislative session to pass a bill that extends the state's ballot certification deadline so that President Joe Biden would be eligible for November's general ballot.\nThe bill's passage comes despite a move by the Democratic National Committee earlier this week that evades the original scheduling issue entirely.\nThe state Senate also passed a bill that would bar foreign contributions to ballot issue campaigns. It passed without any Democratic support.\nBoth bills were passed by the state House on Thursday and now will head to Gov. Mike DeWine's desk for his signature. The Republican governor had called the legislature into a special session this week in order to address these issues.\nAfter DeWine signs the bill, Ohio's ballot certification deadline will be Aug. 23, following the Democratic Party's nominating convention, which starts on Aug. 19.\nEarlier this week, the DNC announced it would virtually nominate the president ahead of its in-person convention in order to work around the need for an Ohio extension in the deadline. With the passage of the Biden ballot fix in the state, the DNC plan in not necessary -- however the DNC said it is planning to move forward with its virtual roll call nomination of Biden ahead of Aug. 7, Ohio's original deadline.\nIn a statement, a DNC spokesperson said they \"already\" took their own action despite \"Ohio Republicans' shenanigans\" of pushing through a separate bill through the special legislative session that bars foreign contributions to ballot issue campaigns -- a bill that Democrats say is a direct response to the ballot measure last year that enshrined abortion protections into the state's constitution.\n\"Joe Biden will be on the ballot in all 50 states, and we are already taking action to make sure that's the case, regardless of Ohio Republicans' shenanigans,\" Hannah Muldavin, DNC senior spokesperson said in a statement.\nSeveral Republicans did not vote for the passage of the Biden ballot fix bill. Others said they would support it, even in light of former President Donald Trump's historic conviction on Thursday.\n\"This bill does give me heartburn. And while the Democrats nationally are blatantly attempting to suppress the votes by weaponizing the justice system and their shenanigans -- shenanigans and kangaroo court, it is tempting to say to the DNC that if you can't follow Ohio existing law, then you don't deserve to have your candidate on the ballot,\" said Republican Sen. Kristina Roegner on the Senate floor on Friday.\n\"But two wrongs don't make a right. And we won't stoop to their level,\" Roegner added.\nDemocrats applauded Republicans for allowing Biden to be on Ohio's ballot.\n\"We have a very divided country right now. And my hope is that actions such as [those] we're taking right now with House Bill Two are an example of how we can work together. As my colleagues across the aisle just said: to have a fair fight, to bring it on. I think that's awesome,\" said Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio said.\nAfter both bills were passed, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, who initially alerted Democrats about the Biden ballot access discrepancy in April, only applauded the General Assembly's passage of the foreign money bill.\n\"As I've said, Ohioans deserve confidence in the integrity of our elections. Although there's been a concentrated effort to confuse this issue through aggressive soccer-flopping and misinformation, this matter is simple: foreign nationals should not be able to interfere with our elections,\" LaRose said in a statement.\n\"The legislation passed today takes an aggressive step toward banning foreign nationals from funding Ohio elections and further cements Ohio's standing as a national leader on election integrity. I applaud the General Assembly for moving quickly to close this campaign finance loophole and I call on every state, as well as Congress, to pass similar measures.\"\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

    "content": "BREAKING: Cannabis farm worker in California dies day after chaotic federal immigration raid\n\nProfile\nSections\nLocal\ntv\nFeatured\nMore From NBC\nFollow NBC News\n news Alerts\nThere are no new alerts at this time\nDemocrats are in an unprecedented crisis over who should be their presidential candidate.\nBut the party committee that governs the nominating process met Friday and proceeded as if everything was normal and its entire plan was not at risk of being upended at any minute.\nAs calls mount for President Joe Biden to step aside and let another Democrat lead the party into the November election against former President Donald Trump, the Democratic National Convention\u2019s Rules Committee held a virtual meeting where the message to delegates was, essentially: Everything is proceeding as planned.\nThe meeting was convened to discuss plans for a virtual roll call vote to formally nominate Biden weeks before the convention, but no votes were taken or decisions made. Instead, party leaders used the meeting to inform the nearly 200 members of the committee about the process that is currently planned, which they had already laid out in a letter earlier this week.\nThe committee will meet again no later than Friday, July 26, to consider adopting the virtual roll call process, which would not be held until the first week of August.\nThe virtual roll call idea has plenty of detractors inside the party, but the only hint of dissent in the meeting came in questions about whether other candidates could be nominated for the virtual roll call (answer: technically yes, but actually, probably not). Otherwise, the virtual meeting was uneventful \u2014 despite starting moments after four more Democratic members of Congress called on Biden to step aside.\nParty leaders like Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison spoke repeatedly about his excitement to \u201crenominate President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris\u201d and to promote the \u201cBiden-Harris ticket.\u201d\nLeah Daughtry, a longtime Democratic rules expert and the co-chair of the Rules Committee, joked about trying to turn the committee members into \u201crules geeks\u201d by the end of the process.\nAnd convention Executive Director Alex Hornbrook, appearing from his office in Chicago with a large, red \u201cBiden\u201d banner over his left shoulder, gushed about the exciting events planned for next month\u2019s convention and touted that the convention is credentialing social media influencers just like traditional reporters to help \u201ctell the story of the Biden-Harris accomplishments\u201d to young people.\nThe purpose of the meeting was to lay out the party\u2019s proposed fix to a paperwork problem that has been causing some outsize heartburn for Democrats as they debate whether Biden should remain their nominee.\nParties typically formally nominate their candidates at their national conventions, during live roll call votes where each state weighs in (Trump was nominated on Monday in this fashion). But since May, Democrats have been discussing plans to nominate Biden weeks before the convention via a virtual vote, in order to avoid a potential legal issue in Ohio.\nOhio has an Aug. 7 deadline for parties to submit the names of their nominees for the ballot, but the Democratic convention does not start until Aug. 19. Similar issues had been fixed easily in years past, but the Republicans who control Ohio\u2019s state Legislature resisted amending the law. They finally did, but waited so long that the fix will not go into effect until Sept. 1 \u2014 meaning the Aug. 7 deadline will still technically be on the books when that date comes and passes.\nOhio\u2019s top election official, Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose, says the issue has been resolved and the discrepancy is not a problem. His spokesperson said Democrats are just trying to \u201cscapegoat Ohio for their own party\u2019s dysfunction.\u201d\nBut Democrats do not trust Republicans and worry that waiting to nominate Biden at the convention could expose them to risky and costly litigation from Republicans. (Trump allies could still sue Ohio officials and insist that a judge rule Biden can\u2019t be on the ballot.)\n\u201cBallot access deadlines are not something to take risks with,\u201d said former Biden White House counsel Dana Remus, who was also general counsel for Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign.\nSome Democrats have worried that the virtual roll call is an attempt to shut down the debate over whether Biden should remain on the ticket and essentially lock in his nomination. But Biden is already in firm control of the process.\nRemus is now acting as legal counsel to the Democratic National Committee. And that role, and her presence on the virtual Rules Committee meeting, underscored how much power his allies have over the party.\nAs is typical for the party that controls the White House, the Democratic National Committee is stacked with handpicked Biden allies, chosen for loyalty as much as anything else.\nAnd during the primaries, in which Biden ran essentially unopposed, he won 99% of the nearly 4,000 pledged delegates to the national convention.\nBiden could still step aside and be replaced after being formally nominated in the virtual roll call, experts say.\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019d be stuck with one person if that person isn\u2019t willing to run,\u201d Elaine Kamarck, a longtime DNC member and party rules expert with the Brookings Institution, said on a separate briefing for Democratic delegates Friday. \u201cIf they have a virtual roll call and Biden then drops out before the convention, the Rules Committee just goes back [and amends the process].\u201d\nAlex Seitz-Wald is a senior political reporter for NBC News. \n\u00a9\u00a02025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

    "publish_date": null,
    "content": "Green Party candidate for president Jill Stein has announced that Dr. Butch Ware is her running mate. The announcement came Friday evening. Ware, a professor at the University of California Santa Barbara, teaches about colonialism, genocide, empire and religion. Stein called him a “man for the moment,” referencing her anti-war platform. “This is truly a historic ticket bringing together a Jewish woman and Black Muslim man against genocide, endless war, climate collapse, and rampant injustice, and for an economy that works for working people, a livable future for our children, and an America and a world that works for all of us,” Stein said in a X post Friday. “With the hand-picked candidates of empire and oligarchy dragging us towards economic breakdown, climate collapse, genocide and World War III, it’s more critical than ever that we come together behind the only anti-war, anti-genocide, pro-worker, climate action campaign with a path to the White House,” the rally announcement on Stein’s website said. Stein is a doctor and environmental activist who also ran for president in 2012 and 2016. Born in Chicago, she graduated from Harvard College in 1973 and from Harvard Medical School in 1979. Among Stein’s policy platforms are abolishing student debt, free child care, a $25 minimum wage indexed to cost inflation and productivity growth and an immediate cease-fire in Israel and Palestine, including an end to the blockade of Gaza. One action Stein says she’d take as president is to immediately end all military aid to Israel and adopt sanctions “until it complies with international law.” In keeping with her views on Gaza, news outlets such as NBC and The Guardian are reporting she’s been recruiting Palestinian Americans to be a vice presidential candidate. Third-party candidates have often had a hard time, especially in federal elections, as some try to challenge their candidacy on ballots in a number of states. Recently, according to the Associated Press, an employee of the Democratic National Committee filed a complaint seeking to remove Stein from the ballot in Wisconsin. “This is why we were fighting, because we are on the ballot already, for the majority of voters,” Stein said in June on “Dan Abrams Live.” “And voters deserve to know information about their candidates. And the debates really ought to include all ballot-qualified candidates.”"

    "content": "The Green Party officially nominated Dr. Jill Stein and Professor Butch Ware at its Presidential Nominating Convention over the weekend. Delegates representing 34 states, Washington, D.C., and four internal party caucuses participated in the convention, which was held remotely. Delegates nominated a presidential ticket on Saturday, during the third day of the party’s Presidential Nominating Convention. Jill Stein, who previously ran as the party’s 2012 and 2016 presidential nominee, secured over 90% of delegate votes, confirming her nomination for a third time. Delegates then voted to nominate Butch Ware, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, whom Stein formally introduced as her running mate the previous evening, as the party’s vice-presidential nominee. A preliminary credentials report adopted earlier in the afternoon indicated there was a total of 299 delegate votes available. The actual number of participants was likely higher than the number of votes; however, as the Green Party adjusts the weight of certain delegation votes to better account for their impact on convention results. State delegations from 34 states, Washington, D.C., and four internal party caucuses—the National Black, Latinx, Lavender Greens, and Women’s Caucuses—were approved to participate in the nominating portion. Stein won the party’s presidential nomination, which was conducted using ranked-choice voting, in the first round with 267 delegate votes. Jasmine Sherman followed with 13 delegate votes, Daví with one vote, Ajamu Baraka with half a vote, and Randy Toler also with half a vote. Seven delegate votes were uncommitted, and three votes went to the None of the Above option. Delegates then voted to confirm Butch Ware as Stein’s vice presidential nominee, with his nomination announced by party election assistants after 54% of tallied delegate votes reflected unanimous support for his selection. A final vote total was not announced and is not yet known at this time.Stein and Ware later appeared together following the vote in a joint press conference to address Green Party members.

Kennedy, Jr. says he will suspend his campaign in the 2024 presidential race and throw his support behind Republican nominee Donald Trump.\nKennedy's support stood at 4% in an\u00a0Ipsos poll\u00a0taken this month, and his campaign appeared to be running out of money, according to Federal Election Commission filings published this week. At the end of last month, Kennedy's campaign owed close to $3.5 million and had only $3.9 million on hand.\nIn a virtual address Friday, Kennedy clarified that he plans to remove his name from the ballot in about 10 battleground states \"where my presence would be a spoiler\" \u2212 a process he has already begun in states including Arizona and Pennsylvania.\nDuring a campaign stop in Las Vegas Trump thanked Kennedy for the \"very nice endorsement\" and said he would discuss it further at an event later today in Arizona.\nMembers of the Kennedy family \u2212 who have previously spoken out against the independent candidate's campaign \u2212 also reacted to the news, calling his endorsement of Trump \"a betrayal of the values that our father and our family hold most dear.\"\n\"It is a sad ending to a sad story,\" the five Kennedys wrote in a joint statement.\nSpeculation that Kennedy would drop out began earlier this week, after his running mate Nicole Shanahan said in an interview Tuesday the campaign had been weighing a decision.\n\u201cThere's two options that we're looking at, and one is staying in, forming that new party, but we run the risk of a Kamala Harris and Walz presidency... or we walk away right now and join forces with\u00a0Donald Trump,\" Shanahan said at the time.\nRumors intensified Wednesday, as ABC News first reported Kennedy's plans to end his campaign, though a decision had not been finalized yet sources then said. Kennedy was seeking a deal with Trump for the promise of a job in the Republican's administration in exchange for an endorsement, Reuters reported at the time.\nTrump is set to appear hours after Kennedy's announcement at a rally in Glendale, Arizona. His campaign has teased an unnamed \"special guest\" appearance, fueling predictions that Kennedy could appear alongside the former president Friday.\nTrump earlier this week called Kennedy \u201ca brilliant\" and \"very smart guy\" \u2212 a far cry from April, when he called him \u201cfar more liberal than anyone running as a Democrat,\" and feared that Kennedy's independent candidacy might cost him votes in the general election.\nKennedy had met with Trump on the first morning of the Republican National Convention in July \"to discuss national unity,\" according to a campaign statement at the time.\nThe Harris campaign in response to Kennedy's suspension offered their ticket as an option to voters \"tired of Donald Trump and looking for a new way forward.\"\n\u201cIn order to deliver for working people and those who feel left behind, we need a leader who will fight for you, not just for themselves, and bring us together, not tear us apart,\" Campaign Chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon\u00a0said in a statement. \"Vice President Harris wants to earn your support.\"\nContributing: David Jackson and Karissa Waddick, Sudiksha Kochi, Bart Jansen USA TODAY"

The source said Arlington officials had made clear that only cemetery staff members would be authorized to take photographs or film in the area, known as Section 60.\nWhen the cemetery official tried to prevent Trump campaign staff from entering Section 60, campaign staff verbally abused and pushed the official aside, according to the source. \nTrump participated in an event to mark the third anniversary of a deadly attack on U.S. troops in Afghanistan as U.S. forces withdrew from the country; 13 U.S. service members were killed in the attack. The Trump campaign has blamed President Biden and Vice President Harris, now the Democratic presidential nominee, for the chaotic withdrawal.\nIn a statement to NPR, Steven Cheung, the Trump campaign's spokesman, strongly rejected the notion of a physical altercation, adding: \"We are prepared to release footage if such defamatory claims are made. \n\"The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony,\" Cheung said in the statement.\nThe Trump campaign declined to make that footage immediately available. On Wednesday the campaign released a video on TikTok that includes Trump's Section 60 visit.\nLate Tuesday night, President Trump posted a photo on social media of the Gold Star families who had invited him. In the post, the families thanked the president and said they had invited the campaign to film in Section 60. But filming there would still contravene federal law,\u00a0\"which prohibits political campaign or election-related activities within the cemeteries.\nAt a campaign event Wednesday, Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance dismissed the story, saying, \"The altercation at Arlington Cemetery is the media creating a story where I really don't think that there is one.\" Vance went on to add that, \"Apparently somebody at Arlington cemetery, some staff member, had a little disagreement with somebody, and they have turned, the media has turned this, into a national news story.\"\nIn a statement to NPR on Tuesday, Arlington National Cemetery said it \"can confirm there was an incident, and a report was filed.\"\n\"Federal law prohibits political campaign or election-related activities within Army National Military Cemeteries, to include photographers, content creators or any other persons attending for purposes, or in direct support of a partisan political candidate's campaign,\" according to the statement. \"Arlington National Cemetery reinforced and widely shared this law and its prohibitions with all participants.\"\nArlington officials updated the statement on Wednesday, writing, \"To protect the identity of the individual involved, no further information about the incident is being released at this time.\"\nSponsor Message\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

    "content": "BREAKING: Cannabis farm worker in California dies day after chaotic federal immigration raid\n\nProfile\nSections\nLocal\ntv\nFeatured\nMore From NBC\nFollow NBC News\n news Alerts\nThere are no new alerts at this time\nFormer Vice President Dick Cheney announced Friday that he will cast his ballot for Vice President Kamala Harris this fall, confirming news that was first made public by his daughter, former Rep. Liz Cheney, earlier in the day.\nBoth Cheneys are Republicans, and the elder served under President George W. Bush. The younger Cheney, who endorsed Harris earlier this week, is one of former President Donald Trump\u2019s most prominent conservative critics.\n\"In our nation\u2019s 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,\" Dick Cheney said in a statement. \"He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him. He can never be trusted with power again.\"\n\u201cAs citizens, we each have a duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution. That is why I will be casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris,\u201d he added.\nHarris campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon said that the vice president was \u201cproud\u201d to have Cheney\u2019s support.\n\u201cHe joins hundreds of Republicans who are backing the Vice President and her patriotic vision of America over former President Trump, because, as Vice President Cheney said, the very future of our republic is at stake in this election,\u201d O\u2019Malley Dillon said in a statement.\nIn a Truth Social post Friday night, Trump bashed both Cheneys, using the acronym for Republican in Name Only. \u201cDick Cheney is an irrelevant RINO, along with his daughter, who lost by the largest margin in the History of Congressional Races!\" he wrote.\nLiz Cheney was ousted in 2021 from her position in House Republican leadership after criticizing Trump. In 2022, she lost her congressional primary race to a Trump-backed challenger.\nDuring the midterm campaign cycle, Dick Cheney taped an advertisement for his daughter\u2019s campaign, in which he called Trump a \u201ccoward.\u201d\nLiz Cheney revealed who her father would vote for during an interview Friday at the Texas Tribune Festival.\n\"Dick Cheney will be voting for Kamala Harris,\" she said.\n\"If you think about the moment that we\u2019re in, and you think about how serious this moment is, my dad believes and he\u2019s said publicly that there\u2019s never been an individual in our country who is as grave a threat to our democracy as Donald Trump is,\" Cheney added. \"And that\u2019s the moment that we\u2019re facing.\"\nAsked for comment Friday about her remarks, Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung replied, \u201cWho the f--- is Liz Cheney?\u201d\nLiz Cheney had said when announcing her support for Harris on Wednesday that people do not have \"the luxury of writing in candidates\u2019 names, particularly in swing states.\"\n\"Because of the danger that\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0poses, not only am I not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris,\" she  said.\nCheney said on Friday that she has not spoken with Harris this week.\nThe former Wyoming congresswoman also said during her Friday interview with The Atlantic's Mark Leibovich that she would support Rep. Colin Allred, D-Texas, in his Senate bid. Allred is challenging Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, who has served in the Senate since 2013.\n\"Here in Texas, you guys do have a tremendous, serious candidate running for the United States Senate, and his name is \u2014\" she paused as the audience cheered and Leibovich asked them to let her speak.\n\"It\u2019s not Ted Cruz,\" she said.\nCheney went on to praise Allred's credentials, noting the time she served in the House with him.\n\"We need people who are going to serve in good faith,\" Cheney said. \"We need people who are honorable public servants, and in this race, that is Colin Allred. So I\u2019ll be working on his behalf.\"\nIn a statement, Allred called Cheney a \"patriot\" and said he was \"honored to have her support.\"\n\"Though we may not agree on everything, we\u2019ve been able to find common ground by putting our country over political parties,\" Allred said. \"Importantly, we both believe in protecting our democracy, our constitution and the foundational promise of our great country. And we both agree that Texans cannot afford six more years of Ted Cruz.\"\nThe Allred campaign also noted that he and Cheney cosponsored more than 50 bills together, a nod to their efforts to work across the aisle.\nWhen reached for comment, a Cruz campaign spokesperson called Cheney \u201cthe poster child of flip-flopping.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely super surprised to hear that Liz Cheney, the poster child of flip-flopping, is endorsing Colin Allred,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cTwo years ago, the voters of Wyoming overwhelmingly rejected her, just like the voters of Texas will overwhelmingly reject Colin Allred this November. But hey, misery loves company.\u201d\nThe Cheneys are the latest in a steady stream of Republicans who, despite policy differences, say they plan to cast ballots for Harris.\nLast week, more than 200 Republicans who have worked for both Bush presidents, Sen. Mitt Romney and the late Sen. John McCain announced that they are backing Harris.\n\"Of course, we have plenty of honest, ideological disagreements with Vice President Harris and Gov. Walz. That\u2019s to be expected,\" said the former staffers said in a statement. \"The alternative, however, is simply untenable.\"\nSeveral prominent GOP critics of Trump, including former Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, appeared onstage at the Democratic National Convention last month to back Harris. In his speech, Kinzinger urged voters to \"put country first\" and argued that Trump has \"suffocated the soul\" of the GOP.\nMegan Lebowitz is a politics reporter for NBC News.\n\u00a9\u00a02025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

    "title": "5 takeaways from the first Harris-Trump debate",
    "url": "https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4873433-vice-president-harris-trump-debate/",
    "publish_date": null,
    "content": "Vice President Harris and former President Trump squared off in a high-stakes first debate in Philadelphia on Tuesday as the polls show the rivals neck and neck ahead of November. Just weeks after a poor debate performance led to President Biden’s historic exit from the presidential race, Harris delivered a sharp showing on the ABC News stage, baiting and sparring with Trump over abortion, race, the economy and more. The tense event marked the rivals’ first ever face-to-face meeting, and Harris has already challenged Trump to a second showdown. Here are five takeaways from Tuesday night: Trump takes the bait\n  Going into the debate, Harris was expected to prod Trump into losing his composure. The strategy appeared to have worked.  Harris immediately made an impression by walking across the stage to shake Trump’s hand, something that has not been seen in recent presidential debates involving Trump. The former president appeared visibly irritated throughout the forum, at many points refusing to look at his rival. Harris deployed several zingers against Trump, saying he “was fired by 81 million people” and that the Biden administration has “cleaned up Donald Trump’s mess.” The vice president even hit Trump over crowd sizes at his rallies, which Trump was quick to hit back on. “I’m gonna invite you to attend one of Donald Trump’s rallies, because it’s a really interesting thing to watch,” Harris said. “He talks about fictional characters like Hannibal Lecter. He will talk about windmills cause cancer,” she continued. “And what you will also notice, is people start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom. And I will tell you the one thing you will not hear him talk about, is you.” The attack clearly rattled Trump. “She said people start leaving. People don’t go to her rallies,” Trump said. “So she can’t talk about that. People don’t leave my rallies.” Throughout the night, Trump was visibly angry, adding to the sense that Harris was getting under his skin. Those optics were clearly advantageous for Harris. Harris delivers sharp performance\n While Trump was visibly rattled during much of the debate, Harris delivered a consistently confident and composed performance. She drew a stark contrast with Trump, not only by keeping her cool but also by positioning herself as the new generational leader. “Clearly, I am not Joe Biden, and I am certainly not Donald Trump. What I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country,” Harris said.  Harris was grilled on several issues that are seen as weak spots for her, including immigration and foreign policy, but generally gave solid answers. The vice president accused Trump of tanking a bipartisan border deal last year, saying “he’d prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.” The Harris campaign clearly thought its candidate won, promptly calling for a second debate in a statement released minutes after the forum wrapped. “Under the bright lights, the American people got to see the choice they will face this fall at the ballot box: between moving forward with Kamala Harris, or going backwards with Trump,” said Jen O’Malley Dillon, Harris’s campaign co-chair. Underscoring Harris’s successful performance, pop superstar Taylor Swift publicly endorsed her on Instagram just minutes after the event ended.The night could hardly have ended better for the vice president. Trump refuses to commit to vetoing national abortion ban\n Trump has said he wouldn’t sign an abortion ban, but he refused to commit to vetoing such a proposal if elected in November. “As far as the abortion ban, no, I’m not in favor of abortion ban, but it doesn’t matter, because this issue has now been taken over by the states,” Trump said. The former president has bragged that he was able to “kill” Roe v. Wade when the Supreme Court overturned federal protections for the procedure two years ago. Pressed on whether he’d veto such a ban, Trump said he “won’t have to,” arguing it’s “just talk” and shifting his answer into a swing at Harris over student loans. One of the moderators, Linsey Davis, urged Trump toward a yes-or-no answer, noting that his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance (R), said last month Trump would shoot down a proposal if it came to his desk.  “I didn’t discuss it with JD, in all fairness. … I don’t mind if he has a certain view,” Trump said, dodging a direct answer. “Look, we don’t have to discuss it, because she’d never be able to get it.”  Harris, on the other hand, slammed Trump over abortion, one of his biggest political vulnerabilities.“The government — and Donald Trump, certainly — should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,” Harris said.The vice president stressed the dire consequences for American women post-Roe, and said she’d “proudly sign” legislation to restore Roe protections if it gets through Congress, drawing a stark contrast with her rival. Right goes after moderators over fact-checking\n ABC’s moderators offered real-time fact-checking on key claims during the contentious debate, a notable change from June’s Trump-Biden debate on CNN. After CNN’s moderators were heavily criticized for letting the candidates chatter unchecked, Davis and David Muir stepped in several times as they steered the conversation.  Muir pushed back on Trump’s unfounded claim that immigrants in Ohio were eating their pets. And after Trump claimed without evidence that Harris’s running mate supports “execution after birth,” Davis quickly noted that “there is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it is born.” And when asked about his previous comments that he lost the 2020 election “by a whisker,” Trump claimed he was being sarcastic. “I didn’t detect the sarcasm,” Muir responded. Conservatives online wasted no time in criticizing Muir and Davis. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said the moderators “might as well be on the DNC payroll.” Conservative media personality Ben Shapiro said they were “a disgrace to their profession.”  “These moderators are a disgraceful failure and this is one of the most biased, unfair debates I have ever seen,” conservative talk show host Megyn Kelly posted on social media.Trump stumbles with ‘concepts of a plan \n Trump delivered one of the night’s most viral moments when he said he had “concepts of a plan” to follow up on his failed efforts to repeal ObamaCare.“We are working on things. We’re going to do it, and we’re going to replace it,” Trump said when asked whether he has a plan to make good on the efforts in a potential second term.  The former president has long criticized the health care law, signed by President Obama in 2010, but Republican efforts to repeal it during his White House tenure fell short. He’s since said he’d keep the law “unless we can do something much better. “I have concepts of a plan. I’m not president right now,” Trump said on the debate stage, when pressed for a yes-or-no on whether he has a plan. “I would only change it if we come up with something that’s better and less expensive. And there are concepts and options we have to do that, and you’ll be hearing about it in the not-too-distant future.” Across the stage, Harris stressed she’d want to “maintain and grow” the Affordable Care Act, noting its resilience through repeated GOP attempts to roll it back, touting her work with the Biden administration to strengthen the law, allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices and cap the cost of insulin."

The agent \"immediately engaged\" with the person holding the rifle. That's when the suspect took off in a black Nissan. A spokesperson for the Secret Service said agents opened fire at the individual.\nBradshaw said the suspect was about 300 to 500 yards from Trump. \"With a rifle and scope like that, it's not a long distance,\" he said. He added that the suspect left two book bags and a GoPro camera. \nA witness was able to provide authorities with the suspect's car model and license plate, according to Bradshaw. Officers later located Routh on Interstate 95.\nMartin County Sheriff William D. Snyder told WPLG that the suspect was \u201crelatively calm\u201d when detained. \u201cHe was not displaying a lot of emotions. Never asked, \u2018What is this about?\u2019\u201d Snyder added.\nIn July, the Republican presidential nominee was wounded in an assassination attempt by a gunshot at a rally in Butler, Pa.\nIn an email sent out by his campaign, Trump wrote \"There were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL!\u201d\nTrump later wrote on Truth Social to \"thank everyone for your concern and well wishes,\" and wrote, \"It was certainly an interesting day!\"\nTrump's post continued: \"Most importantly, I want to thank the U.S. Secret Service, Sheriff Ric Bradshaw and his Office of brave and dedicated Patriots, and, all of Law Enforcement, for the incredible job done today at Trump International in keeping me, as the 45th President of the United States, and the Republican Nominee in the upcoming Presidential Election, SAFE. THE JOB DONE WAS ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING. I AM VERY PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!\"\nTrump\u2019s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, said he spoke to Trump after the shooting. \u201cI'm glad President Trump is safe. I spoke to him before the news was public and he was, amazingly, in good spirits,\u201d he wrote on X.\nLocal officials said the whole golf course would have been surrounded if it had been a sitting president. But for a presidential nominee, there were only some Secret Service agents with him and the shrubbery surrounding the golf course made detection harder.\n\"The threat level is high,\" Rafael Barros, Special Agent in Charge of the Miami Field Office, told news reporters, adding that \u201cwe have increased the amount of assets.\u201d He added, \"We live in dangerous times.\"\nThe White House said President Biden and Vice President Harris were also briefed about the security incident at the Trump International golf course. \n\"They are\u00a0relieved to know that he is safe. They will be kept regularly updated by their team,\" the statement said.

    "content": "Exclusive: America Pac has up to 400 employees in each of the seven key states, with the campaign dependent on it\nDonald Trump\u2019s wider ground game operation in crucial battleground states is now largely outsourced to America Pac, the political action committee backed by the billionaire Elon Musk, according to multiple people familiar with the situation.\nThe Trump campaign gambled with its voter turnout efforts for the 2024 cycle and outsourced it to Super Pacs, while it targeted its focus on turning out Trump supporters in rural areas who typically do not vote.\nBut while the Trump campaign once predicted having multiple Pacs doing get-out-the-vote work, with six weeks until the election, only America Pac has a material presence of 300 to 400 paid and part-time people knocking on doors in each of the seven battleground states, the people said.\nAmerica Pac also remains the only entity \u2013 Trump campaign or otherwise \u2013 with a target to do three \u201cpasses\u201d of homes of likely Trump voters in every battleground state before election day.\nTurning Point Action, run by the rightwing activist Charlie Kirk and touted by the Trump campaign, for instance, has a smaller footprint; it has a presence in Arizona, Wisconsin and two specific districts in Michigan and Nevada, after dropping Georgia from its initial list.\nThe situation means America Pac now accounts for an outsize proportion of the unglamorous but critical work of door-knocking and canvassing Trump voters in battleground states to get them to return a ballot.\nAnd since the Trump campaign does not have its own mass field operation \u2013 it has a new model of \u201cTrump 47 Captains\u201d, volunteers targeting likely Trump supporters who do not typically vote \u2013 the campaign has little backup if America Pac hits snags.\nLast week, America Pac fired the company it had retained in Arizona and Nevada to do door-knocking and canvassing.\nThe move to terminate the September Group had damaging consequences for Trump as America Pac lost several days of canvassing while they sought a replacement company, and lost at least some of the roughly 300 people they hired in each state.\nThe Trump campaign denied that it had a reliance on America Pac and said it had more than 27,000 volunteers working as Trump 47 Captains, the program in which ardent Trump supporters receive special Maga merchandise as they get more people to register to vote.\nEach volunteer initially receives a list of 10 neighbors to mobilize. If they meet that target, the next tier involves canvassing 24 out of 50 likely Trump voters, followed by canvassing 45 out of 100 voters, with new perks at each tier.\n\u201cTeam Trump has hundreds of staff and offices mobilizing hundreds of thousands of volunteers across the country. That\u2019s why everyone wants to take credit for our groundbreaking, data-enhanced, people-powered operation,\u201d Karoline Leavitt, a Trump spokesperson, said in a statement.\nBut a person involved with America Pac expressed skepticism about the reach of the Trump 47 captains and noted targeting just so-called low propensity voters in rural areas is no substitute for hitting doors in suburban areas and cities as well.\nSeparately, if Trump wins, it could be in part thanks to Musk, who has articulated wider political ambitions \u2013 he recently pitched to Trump to run a government efficiency commission and Trump has said he would consider putting Musk in his cabinet \u2013 and resultantly have outsized influence with Trump.\nThe America Pac ground game operation was slow to get started after it scrapped its initial plans, and only started hiring employees at a rapid clip last month.\nBut it has since exploded in size. By retaining canvassing vendors for each battleground state, America Pac\u2019s operation now involves hundreds of paid and part-time employees to knock on doors in an unusually aggressive get-out-the-vote effort, the person said.\nIn North Carolina and Michigan, America Pac\u2019s vendor, Blitz Canvassing LLC, has hired more than 400 staffers in each state, the person said. America Pac has paid roughly $3.3m to Blitz to date, according to federal campaign finance filings.\nBlitz is now also responsible for Arizona and Nevada after it was named as the successor to the September Group. It has a mandate to rehire as many of the fired 300 canvassers as possible, and in Nevada, to hit roughly 30,000 doors a day.\nThe retention of Blitz has been controversial inside Trump world, in part because Blitz is a subsidiary of a company called GP3 owned by the political consultants running America Pac. It has given rise to accusations that America Pac\u2019s leadership is profiting twice.\nFor Pennsylvania and Georgia, America Pac has subcontracted to Patriot Grassroots LLC and paid about $2.3m to date. For Wisconsin, America Pac has subcontracted to the Synapse Group for about $468,000, according to campaign finance filings."

Over and again, Walz and Vance outlined the policy and character differences between their running mates, while trying to introduce themselves to the country. \nHere are some takeaways from Tuesday\u2019s debate.\n\n\nIran\u2019s ballistic missile attack on Israel on Tuesday elicited a contrast between the Democratic and Republican tickets on foreign policy: Walz promised \u201csteady leadership\u201d under Harris while Vance pledged a return to \u201cpeace through strength\u201d if Trump is returned to the White House.\nThe differing visions of what American leadership should look like overshadowed the sharp policy differences between the two tickets.\nThe Iranian threat to the region and U.S. interests around the world opened the debate, with Walz pivoting the topic to criticism of Trump.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter,\u201d Walz said, then referenced the \u201cnearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes\u201d and responding to global crises by tweet.\nVance, for his part, promised a return to \u201ceffective deterrence\u201d under Trump against Iran, brushing back on Walz\u2019s criticism of Trump by attacking Harris and her role in the Biden administration.\n\u201cWho has been the vice president for the last three and a half years and the answer is your running mate, not mine,\u201d he said. He pointedly noted that the Hamas attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, happened \u201cduring the administration of Kamala Harris.\u201d\nRepublican vice presidential nominee Sen.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke)\n\nVance and Walz trained the bulk of their attacks not on their onstage rivals, but on the running mates who weren\u2019t in the room. \nBoth vice presidential nominees sought to convey a genial mien as they lobbed criticism at Harris and Trump, respectively. \nIt was a reflection of the fact that most voters don\u2019t cast a ballot based on the vice president, and on a vice presidential nominee\u2019s historic role in serving as the attack dog for their running mates. \nWalz pointedly attacked Trump for failing to meet his pledge of building a physical barrier across the entire U.S.-Mexico border at the country\u2019s southern neighbor\u2019s expense.\n\u201cLess than 2% of that wall got built and Mexico didn\u2019t pay a dime,\u201d Walz said. \nUnderscoring the focus on the top of the ticket, during a back-and-forth about immigration, Vance said to his opponent, \u201cI think that you want to solve this problem, but I don\u2019t think that Kamala Harris does.\u201d\nViewers in the spin room watch the CBS News vice presidential debate, Tuesday, Oct. 1, 2024, in New York.

Both candidates took a low-key approach and both enthusiastically delved into the minutiae.\nWalz dug into the drafting of the Affordable Care Act when he was in the House in 2009, and pushed Vance on the senator\u2019s claim that Trump, who tried to eliminate the law, actually helped preserve it. Vance, defending his claim that illegal immigration pushes up housing prices, cited a Federal Reserve study to back himself up. Walz talked about how Minneapolis tinkered with local regulations to boost the housing supply. Both men talked about the overlap between energy policy, trade and climate change.\nIt was a very different style than often seen in presidential debates over the past several election cycles.\nWalz pounced on Vance repeatedly over abortion access and reproductive rights as the Ohio senator tried to argue that a state-by-state matrix of abortion laws is the ideal approach for the United States. Walz countered that a \u201cbasic right\u201d for a woman should not be determined \u201cby geography.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a very simple proposition: These are women\u2019s decisions,\u201d Walz said. \u201cWe trust women. We trust doctors.\u201d\nWalz sought to personalize the issue by referencing the death of Amber Thurman, who waited more than 20 hours at the hospital for a routine medical procedure known as a D&C to clear out remaining tissue after taking abortion pills. She developed sepsis and died.\nDemocratic vice presidential nominee Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz speaks during a vice presidential debate hosted by CBS News, with Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, Tuesday, Oct. 1, 2024, in New York. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke)\n\nRather than sidestep the reference, Vance at one point agreed with Walz that \u201cAmber Thurman should still be alive.\u201d\nVance steered the conversation to the GOP ticket\u2019s proposals he said would help women and children economically, thus avoiding the need for terminating pregnancies. But Walz retorted that such policies \u2014 tax credits, expanded childcare aid, a more even economy \u2014 can be pursued while still allowing women to make their own decisions about abortion.\nIn the wake of the devastation of Hurricane Helene, Vance took a question about climate change and gave an answer about jobs and manufacturing, taking a detour around Trump\u2019s past claims that global warming is a \u201choax.\u201d\nVance contended that the best way to fight climate change was to move more manufacturing to the United States, because the country has the world\u2019s cleanest energy economy. It was a distinctly domestic spin on a global crisis, especially after Trump pulled the U.S. out of the international Paris climate accords during his administration.\nWalz also kept the climate change focus domestic, touting the Biden administration\u2019s renewable energy investments as well as record levels of oil and natural gas production.\nIt was a decidedly optimistic take on a pervasive and grim global problem.\nThe two running mates agreed that the number of migrants in the U.S. illegally is a problem. But each laid the blame on the opposing presidential nominee.\nVance echoed Trump by repeatedly calling Harris the \u201cborder czar\u201d and suggested that she, as vice president, single-handedly rolled back the immigration restrictions Trump had imposed as president. The result, in Vance\u2019s telling, is an unchecked flow of fentanyl, strain on state and local resources and increased housing prices around the country.\nHarris was never asked to be the \u201cborder czar\u201d and she was never specifically given the responsibility for security on the border. She was tasked by Biden in March 2021 with tackling the \u201croot causes\u201d of migration from the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador and pushing leaders there and in Mexico to enforce immigration laws. Harris was not empowered to set U.S. immigration policy \u2014 only the president can sign executive orders and Harris was not empowered as Biden\u2019s proxy in negotiations with Congress on immigration law.\nWalz advanced Democrats\u2019 arguments that Trump single-handedly killed a bipartisan Senate deal to tighten border security and boost the processing system for immigrants and asylum seekers. Republicans backed off the deal, Walz noted, only after Trump said it wasn\u2019t good enough.\nRepublican vice presidential nominee Sen.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke)\n\nAsked directly whether Trump\u2019s promise to deport millions of illegal immigrants would remove parents of U.S.-born children, Vance never answered the question. Instead, the senator tried to put his best spin on Trump\u2019s plan to use the military to help with deportations and pivot to attacking Harris for a porous border. Asked to respond to Trump\u2019s having called climate change a \u201choax,\u201d Vance also avoided a response.\nThe debate kicked off with Walz being asked if he\u2019d support a preemptive strike by Israel against Iran. Walz praised Harris\u2019 foreign policy leadership but never answered that question, either.\nAnd at the end of the debate, Vance would not answer Walz\u2019s direct question of whether Trump indeed lost the 2020 election.\nWalz had several verbal stumbles on a night in which he admitted to \u201cmisspeaking\u201d often. In the debate\u2019s opening moments, he confused Iran and Israel when discussing the Middle East.\nAt one point he said he had \u201cbecome friends with school shooters,\u201d and he stumbled through an explanation of inaccurate remarks about whether he was in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. ( He was not.)\nBut the governor noticeably put Vance on the defensive over abortion and, near the end of the debate, with a pointed question about whether Trump won the 2020 election. \nThe candidates went out of their way to be polite to each other until the very end, when Vance refused to back down from his statements that he wouldn\u2019t have certified Trump\u2019s 2020 election loss.\nVance tried to turn the issue to claims that the \u201cmuch bigger threat to democracy\u201d was Democrats trying to censor people on social media. But Walz wouldn\u2019t let go.\n\u201cThis one is troubling to me,\u201d said Walz, noting that he\u2019d just been praising some of Vance\u2019s answers. He rattled off the ways Trump tried to overturn his 2020 loss and noted that the candidate still insists he won that contest. Then Walz asked Vance if Trump actually lost the election.\nVance responded by asking if Harris censored people.\n\u201cThat is a damning non-answer,\u201d said Walz, noting that Trump\u2019s former vice president, Mike Pence, wasn\u2019t on the debate stage because he stood up to Trump on Jan. 6, 2021, and presided over Congress\u2019 certification of the former president\u2019s loss.\n\u201cAmerica,\u201d Walz concluded, \u201cI think you\u2019ve got a really clear choice on this election of who\u2019s going to honor that democracy and who\u2019s going to honor Donald Trump.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

    "content": "The America PAC, founded by tech billionaire Elon Musk, is asking the public to sign a petition in favor of the First and Second Amendments and offering supporters $47 for each subsequent registered voter a person gets to sign the petition in swing states.Musk, who has endorsed former President Trump’s White House bid, encouraged his followers on the social platform X to sign the pledge and make referrals. “For every person you refer who is a swing state voter, you get $47! Easy money,” Musk wrote in his post on the site he bought two years ago. The petition pledges support for the Constitution’s first two amendments, which, according to the petition’s description, “guarantee freedom of speech and the right to bear arms.” The offer is valid for the next two weeks. The America PAC is setting out to secure the signatures of 1 million registered voters in the seven key swing states: Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina. It comes as the Trump and Vice President Harris campaigns kick into high gear in the battleground states. The election has become a nail-biter since Harris’s entry into the race — especially in those swing states, where polls have placed the distance between the two candidates often within the margin of error. According to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ’s national polling average, Harris leads Trump by 3.4 percentage points, 49.8 percent to Trump’s 46.4 percent. Decision Desk HQ’s polling average shows Trump leading Harris by 1.2 points in Arizona and 0.7 points in both Georgia and North Carolina. Harris, meanwhile, leads by 0.2 points in Michigan, 2 points in Nevada, 0.8 points in Pennsylvania and 1.3 points in Wisconsin. The Hill has reached out to Musk’s PAC for comment."

(Sean Simmers/The Patriot-News via AP)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElon Musk, the billionaire founder of Tesla and Space X and owner of X who\u2019s gone all-in on Republican Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy for the White House, has already committed at least $70 million to help the former president. Now he\u2019s pledging to give away $1 million a day to voters for signing his political action committee\u2019s petition backing the Constitution. \nThe giveaway is raising questions and alarms among some election experts who say it is a violation of the law to link a cash handout to signing a petition that also requires a person to be registered to vote. \n\u25b6 Follow live updates on Election 2024 as Donald Trump and Kamala Harris campaign in strategic battleground states. \nDemocratic Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, the state\u2019s former attorney general, expressed concern about the plan on Sunday. \n\u201cI think there are real questions with how he is spending money in this race, how the dark money is flowing, not just into Pennsylvania, but apparently now into the pockets of Pennsylvanians. That is deeply concerning,\u201d he said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \nA closer look at what\u2019s going on: \nMusk promised on Saturday that he would give away $1 million a day, until the Nov. 5 election, for people signing his PAC\u2019s petition supporting the First Amendment, which protects freedom of speech, and the Second Amendment, with its right \u201cto keep and bear arms.\u201d He awarded a check during an event Saturday in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to a man identified as John Dreher. A message left with a number listed for Dreher was not returned Sunday. Musk gave out another check Sunday.\nMusk\u2019s America PAC has launched a tour of Pennsylvania, a critical election battleground. He\u2019s aiming to register voters in support of Trump, whom Musk has endorsed. The PAC is also pushing to persuade voters in other key states. It\u2019s not the first offer of cash the organization has made. Musk has posted on X, the platform he purchased as Twitter before renaming it, that he would offer people $47 \u2014 and then $100 \u2014 for referring others to register and signing the petition. \nTrump, who was campaigning Sunday in Pennsylvania, was asked about Musk\u2019s giveaway, and said, \u201cI haven\u2019t followed that.\u201d Trump said he \u201cspeaks to Elon a lot. He\u2019s a friend of mine\u201d and called him great for the country. \nSome election law experts are raising red flags about the giveaway. Brendan Fischer, a campaign finance lawyer, said the latest iteration of Musk\u2019s giveaway approaches a legal boundary. That\u2019s because the PAC is requiring registration as a prerequisite to become eligible for the $1 million check. \u201cThere would be few doubts about the legality if every Pennsylvania-based petition signer were eligible, but conditioning the payments on registration arguably violates the law,\u201d Fischer said in an email. \nRick Hasen, a UCLA Law School political science professor, went further. He pointed to a law that prohibits paying people for registering to vote or for voting. \u201cIf all he was doing was paying people to sign the petition, that might be a waste of money. But there\u2019s nothing illegal about it,\u201d Hasen said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe problem is that the only people eligible to participate in this giveaway are the people who are registered to vote. And that makes it illegal.\u201d \nMichael Kang, an election law professor at Northwestern University\u2019s Pritzker School of Law, said the context of the giveaway so close to Election Day makes it harder to make the case that the effort is anything but a incentivizing people to register to vote. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not quite the same as paying someone to vote, but you\u2019re getting close enough that we worry about its legality,\u201d Kang said. \nA message seeking comment was left with the PAC on Sunday, as was a request for comment from the Justice Department.\nTypically coordination between campaigns and so-called super PACs had been forbidden. But a recent opinion by the Federal Election Commissioner, which regulates federal campaigns, permitted candidates and these groups to work together in certain cases, including getting out the vote efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

    "content": "PHOENIX \u2014 An arrest has reportedly been made after a Phoenix United States Postal Service mailbox was believed to have been set on fire overnight, damaging a number of mailed-in ballots.\nEmergency crews were called to the USPS Osborn Station, near 7th Avenue and Indian School Road, around 1:30 a.m. where a drive-up mail collection box was on fire.\nPhoenix Fire Department said an unknown person lit a fire inside the blue drive-up collection box and fled the area.\nCrews were able to quickly extinguish the blaze, but investigators were later seen going through pieces of mail that had been burned in the fire.\n\"Approximately 20 electoral ballots were damaged, along with additional miscellaneous mail,\" Phoenix Fire Department officials said. The Postal Inspector has since taken possession of the damaged ballots and mail. \nPhoenix police say surveillance video helped them quickly track down and arrest the suspect, a 35-year-old male, for an unrelated warrant. While in police custody, he allegedly admitted to starting the fire but claimed he \"wanted to be arrested\" and that his actions were not politically motivated and unrelated to the election.\nThanks to swift action by @PhoenixPolice, @PHXFire and federal partners, we have arrested the suspect involved in this incident. https://t.co/DRkqz06All\nA USPS spokesperson and postal inspector told ABC15, \"This does not happen often and is rare,\" and urged people to place mail in collection boxes before the last collection time each day. \n\"Postal Inspectors are working with the local election commission to ensure any affected election mail is remedied and that other mail is routed to the appropriate parties,\" USPS said in a statement. \"If you believe your mail-in ballot may have been impacted by this incident, please contact your local election office to confirm receipt and identify options for tracking your ballot. If you believe your mail was impacted by this recent incident, please file a report directly with the U.S. Postal Inspection Service by calling 877-876-2455 (say 'Theft') or by visiting www.uspis.gov/report.\"\nUSPS continued: \"The Inspection Service takes all reports of election offenses involving the U.S. Mail very seriously. Postal Inspectors are immediately reviewing and addressing all complaints of impacted political or election mail. Anyone who steals, disrupts, delays or otherwise tampers with political or election mail should know that the full investigative strength of the federal government will be directed toward them, including Postal Inspectors, special agents with the USPS Office of Inspector General and Federal Bureau of Investigation, and prosecutors with the Department of Justice. This 'zero tolerance' approach ensures that American citizens can vote with the confidence that their mail and the election, two of America\u2019s most trusted institutions, are free from criminal disruption.\"\nABC15 also reached out to election officials for information impacting those whose ballots may have been damaged: \nMaricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer released the following statement: \n\u201cWe are waiting for details from law enforcement. We encourage all voters who used that mail box in the last 36 hours to check the status of their ballots at https://BeBallotReady.Vote. Successful delivery is usually reflected on that website within 72 hours. Voters should be aware that tomorrow, October 25 is the last day to request a replacement ballot. If a voter believes they were impacted by this incident they can learn more about how to make that request at https://Request.Maricopa.Vote.\u201d\nArizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes released the following statement about the incident: \n\"I have been alerted to the recent attack on a USPS collection box in Phoenix, which damaged several ballots. Thanks to the swift response coordinated between election officials, law enforcement, and the postal service, we were able to recover many undamaged ballots and affected voters will be contacted to make sure they\u2019re able to cast a vote. Any attack that strikes at our democratic process carries criminal consequences. Ballot abuse is a felony in Arizona, and mailbox vandalism is a federal crime. We extend our heartfelt thanks to the Phoenix Fire Department, Phoenix Police, and Arizona USPS for their swift and effective response, which helped save many ballots.

    "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/10/25/washington-post-endorsement-president/",
    "publish_date": null,
    "content": "The Washington Post’s publisher said Friday that the paper will not make an endorsement in this year’s presidential contest, for the first time in 36 years, or in future presidential races. The decision, announced 11 days before an election that most polls show as too close to call, drew immediate and heated condemnation from a wide swath of subscribers, political figures and media commentators. Robert Kagan, a longtime Post columnist and editor-at-large in the opinion department, resigned in protest, and a group of 11 Washington Post columnists co-signed an article condemning the decision. Angry readers and sources flooded the email inboxes of numerous staffers with complaints. In a column published on The Post’s website Friday, publisher and CEO William Lewis described the decision as a return to the newspaper’s roots of non-endorsement. The Post did not begin regularly endorsing presidential candidates until 1976, when the paper endorsed Jimmy Carter “for understandable reasons at the time,” Lewis wrote. “We recognize that this will be read in a range of ways, including as a tacit endorsement of one candidate, or as a condemnation of another, or as an abdication of responsibility. That is inevitable,” Lewis wrote. “We don’t see it that way. We see it as consistent with the values The Post has always stood for and what we hope for in a leader: character and courage in service to the American ethic, veneration for the rule of law, and respect for human freedom in all its aspects.” Lewis also portrayed the decision as a “statement in support of our readers’ ability to make up their own minds.” Within hours of the announcement, a group of Washington Post columnists, including Pulitzer Prize winner Eugene Robinson and former deputy editorial page editor Ruth Marcus, called the decision “a terrible mistake,” writing, “This is a moment for the institution to be making clear its commitment to democratic values, the rule of law and international alliances, and the threat that Donald Trump poses to them — the precise points The Post made in endorsing Trump’s opponents in 2016 and 2020.” Washington Post legends Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein issued a statement saying: “We respect the traditional independence of the editorial page, but this decision 12 days out from the 2024 presidential election ignores the Washington Post’s own overwhelming reportorial evidence on the threat Donald Trump poses to democracy. Under Jeff Bezos’s ownership, the Washington Post’s news operation has used its abundant resources to rigorously investigate the danger and damage a second Trump presidency could cause to the future of American democracy and that makes this decision even more surprising and disappointing, especially this late in the electoral process.” The Post decision marks the second time this week that a major media organization has declined to issue an endorsement in the race between the Republican nominee, former president Donald Trump, and his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, after years of making such endorsements. Earlier this week, Patrick Soon-Shiong, the billionaire owner of the Los Angeles Times, blocked a planned endorsement of Harris, prompting the resignation of the newspaper’s editorials editor. An endorsement of Harris had been drafted by Post editorial page staffers but had yet to be published, according to two people who were briefed on the sequence of events and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The decision to no longer publish presidential endorsements was made by The Post’s owner, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, according to four people who were briefed on the decision. “This was a Washington Post decision to not endorse, and I would refer you to the publisher’s statement in full,” said Chief Communications Officer Kathy Baird. The Post plans to continue issuing endorsements in other races, including local contests, a spokeswoman said. The Post’s decision has roiled many on the paper’s opinions staff, which operates independently from The Post’s news staff, a long-standing tradition of American journalism designed to separate opinion writing from day-to-day news coverage. The Post’s editorial board was informed Friday by Opinion Editor David Shipley in a tense meeting. Multiple members of the board expressed vehement opposition, according to two attendees who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The timing of the announcement was especially jarring because it came just one day after two Post opinion writers — editorial board member David Hoffman and contributing columnist Vladimir Kara-Murza — received Pulitzer Prizes at a ceremony in New York. Hoffman’s series of articles was called “Annals of Autocracy.” “It’s a sort of preemptive bending of the knee to who they may think is the probable winner,” said Kagan, whose resignation was first reported by Semafor. “Anybody who is as much a part of the American economy as Bezos is … they obviously want to have a good relationship with whoever is in power. [It’s] an attempt to try not to be on the wrong side of Donald Trump.” On social media, some readers announced their intent to cancel subscriptions, while a few applauded the new policy for being unbiased. The Washington Post Guild, which represents newsroom employees, released a statement saying members are concerned that The Post would “make the decision to no longer endorse presidential candidates, especially a mere 11 days” before the election. “The role of an Editorial Board is to do just this: to share opinions on the news impacting our society and culture and endorse candidates to help guide readers,” the statement said. “The message from our chief executive, Will Lewis — not from the Editorial Board itself — makes us concerned that management interfered with the work of our members in Editorial.” On social media, celebrities such as author Stephen King and actor Jeffrey Wright — who is from Washington — said they were canceling their subscriptions. Susan Rice, who served as national security adviser under President Barack Obama and is a former domestic policy adviser to the Biden White House, wrote on X, “As a DC native and lifelong subscriber to the Post, I’m disgusted. You have lost us.” Two former executive editors of The Post also weighed in with scathing criticism. “This is cowardice, a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty. Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners),” former Post executive editor Martin Baron, who led the paper while Trump was president, said in a text message to The Post. “History will mark a disturbing chapter of spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.” Marcus Brauchli, The Post’s editor from 2008 to 2012, wrote in an email that “the decision looks craven. In the same way that readers expect newsrooms and reporters to tell them what’s happening, they look to editorial boards to help them to reason through complex events and reach informed conclusions. In a campaign awash in lies and misinformation, the value of a well-considered endorsement is greater than ever.” As the news was being processed, Post journalists huddled in angry knots. One of the paper’s biggest stars — Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter and best-selling author Carol D. Leonnig — said in an email: “I don’t care who the Post opinion section endorses. … For me, and for the readers and sources who today have flooded me with calls and messages, what’s curious is the timing and odd explanation of this endorsement change. It raises concerns about the thing I do care so deeply about: whether our ownership will continue to let my colleagues and me pursue hard-hitting reporting, independently, without worrying who is upset with our coverage.” Earlier this week, the Los Angeles Times faced scrutiny and reader backlash over Soon-Shiong’s decision not to publish the planned endorsement of Harris. The biotech mogul said he wanted the editorial board to provide an analysis of each candidate’s policies to give readers “clear and non-partisan information side-by-side.” The decision prompted the resignation of editorials editor Mariel Garza, who said the move made the paper look “craven and hypocritical.” Soon-Shiong’s daughter, Nika Soon-Shiong, wrote on social media that the decision not to endorse a candidate has prompted “controversy and confusion,” and she implied that the decision had to do with the Biden-Harris administration’s policies on Israel and Gaza. “This is not a vote for Donald Trump. This is a refusal to ENDORSE a candidate that is overseeing a war on children,” she wrote. “I trust the Editorial Board’s judgment. For me, genocide is the line in the sand.” The Post has not always issued presidential election endorsements. In announcing the paper’s decision Friday, Lewis cited an editorial that The Post’s editorial board wrote in 1960 explaining its decision not to endorse a candidate in that year’s presidential race, the same practice it had followed in five of the six previous elections, the exception being an endorsement of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952: “In the light of hindsight we retain the view that the arguments for [Eisenhower’s] nomination and election were compelling. But hindsight also has convinced us that it might have been wiser for an independent newspaper in the Nation’s Capital to have avoided formal endorsement.” Beginning in 1976, however, The Post began regularly endorsing candidates during each presidential election cycle, with the exception of 1988, when it declined to make a recommendation in the contest between George H.W. Bush and Michael Dukakis. In the 1976 race, The Post endorsed Democrat Jimmy Carter. All of its subsequent endorsements have been Democrats."

Activate your online access\nThe Biden administration\u2019s action, and inaction, in Gaza\u2014and her support for those policies\u2014should have been enough to disqualify her.\nThe Biden administration\u2019s action, and inaction, in Gaza\u2014and her support for those policies\u2014should have been enough to disqualify her.\nVice President Kamala Harris meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the vice president\u2019s ceremonial office at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in Washington, DC, on July 25, 2024.\nOn September 23, The Nation endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president. \u201cOf course we endorse Harris over Trump,\u201d the unsigned editorial reads. \u201cBut we also endorse Harris in her own right, as an experienced and capable leader with a vision for America\u2019s future\u2026that represents a clear advance on Democratic nominees of the past half century.\u201d The endorsement goes on to cite the magazine\u2019s abolitionist founders\u2014\u201cboth visionary radicals and deeply practical politicians\u201d\u2014as touchstones for the decision to support Harris.\nWe, The Nation\u2019s current interns, find this endorsement unearned and disappointing. We have a different interpretation of the magazine\u2019s abolitionist legacy, one that says a publication committed to justice must refrain from endorsing a person signing off on genocide. We do not support Donald Trump, but to champion Harris at this moment is to ignore the atrocities that are being carried out with weapons supplied by the Biden-Harris administration.\nThe Nation\u2019s endorsement notes that on foreign policy the \u201cpositive case [for Harris] is harder to make,\u201d adding that \u201cshe has failed so far to offer anything more substantive to the millions of Americans\u2026desperate for an end to America\u2019s unconditional support for Israel\u2019s brutal war on Gaza.\u201d Yet it goes on to endorse her anyway\u2014implying that domestic concerns are somehow more important. We disagree. On the grounds of Gaza alone, Harris should not have received The Nation\u2019s endorsement.\nIn the 12 weeks since she effectively became the Democratic nominee, Harris has failed to differentiate her policies from Joe Biden\u2019s blank-check support for genocide. Instead, she repeats the same bland pronouncements about the need for a ceasefire and uses the same passive-voice support for the idea of Palestinian \u201cfreedom and self-determination.\u201d Again and again, she has been asked by Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim voters, along with a broad coalition of Democrats of conscience, to offer an alternative, and again and again she has refused. She would not even allow a pre-vetted Palestinian supporter of hers to speak at the Democratic National Convention.\nWe have watched this abdication of moral responsibility by the Democratic nominee with a growing sense of dismay. As young journalists, we think of our colleagues in Gaza. Israel has killed more than 175 journalists in Gaza since last October\u2014and right now, with US support and the Western media\u2019s indifference, Israel is effectively issuing hit lists of reporters in Gaza. During the last year, The Nation has published dispatches from Palestinian journalists, from 14-year-old Lujayn to the journalist Mohammed Mhawish, both of whom have survived air strikes, most likely from US-made weapons. We cannot advocate for a person who is complicit in the murders of fellow journalists and the bombing of colleagues whose pieces we have fact-checked.\nWe also struggle with the idea that Harris\u2019s domestic agenda can offset the suffering her policies will inflict abroad. As we map even her sunniest domestic proposals against the contours of her foreign-policy program, we remember James Baldwin, a Nation Editorial Board member, who said, \u201cEvery bombed village is my hometown.\u201d\nHarris, for instance, promises to provide tax credits to families with newborns and to sign a law to restore the right to abortion nationwide. Yet her commitment to the welfare of children doesn\u2019t extend to the more than 17,000 kids killed in Gaza, hundreds of whom died from inadequate postnatal care like incubators. She will fight for reproductive care in the United States, but in Gaza, tens of thousands of mothers have or will give birth without access to doctors, pain relief, hospitals, or food and water.\nHarris also pledges to strengthen our healthcare system. But in Gaza, as many as 1,000 healthcare workers have been killed, 30 of 36 hospitals have been damaged or destroyed, and fewer than half are even partially functional. People routinely die from the blockade of basic sanitary equipment, ordinary medicines, and vaccines.\nHarris\u2019s plans to relieve the housing crisis in the United States ring hollow next to her support for Israel\u2019s destruction of homes in Gaza, the West Bank, and Lebanon. With the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s full knowledge and aid, 90 percent of Gazans have been forcibly displaced, and hundreds of thousands of homes have been damaged and destroyed. Nor has the administration done anything to stop the demolitions of houses and illegal expansion of settlements in the West Bank.\n\nJeet Heer \n\nJohn Nichols \n\nGregg Gonsalves \n\nChris Lehmann \nWhile the Harris campaign declares that \u201cno one is above the law,\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu breaks international human-rights law with impunity, as does his country. The International Court of Justice has condemned Israel\u2019s illegal settlement and occupation of Palestinian territory as unlawful, while the International Court of Justice has found it \u201cplausible\u201d that Israel is committing genocide. Nor has the Biden administration itself proved to be terribly law-abiding. The president, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin have all been accused of violating the Genocide Convention and international law. Blinken has deliberately broken the law by covering up reports by two US agencies that found that Israel was carrying out war crimes in Gaza and should be denied further military aid. Meanwhile, the State Department has failed to enforce the Leahy law, which requires sanctions against militaries committing war crimes\u2014like Israel\u2019s notorious Netzah Yehuda battalion.\nWhile some express hope that Harris will break with Biden on Israel as soon as she is elected, they would do well to remember that the current administration has hardly broken from Trump: It completed Trump\u2019s plan to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem and reaffirmed his acknowledgment of the illegally occupied Golan Heights as Israeli territory. There is no evidence that Biden has constrained Netanyahu in his war, and any belief Harris would do so is wishful thinking.\nAt the same time as the Harris campaign has spurned Palestinian supporters, it has rebuffed the left more broadly. Harris has made it clear that she thinks she can win the White House by attracting more conservative voters. She is now posing as sufficiently right-wing that high-profile Republicans feel comfortable signing off on her candidacy. The Republicans for Harris movement\u2019s membership lists the likes of Anthony Scarramucci and Stephanie Grisham\u2014both of whom were part of Trump\u2019s cabinet (and could vie for a spot in Harris\u2019s administration as well, since she has promised it will include at least one Republican). In endorsing Harris, The Nation also now finds itself in the company of former vice president Dick Cheney, a principal architect of the Iraq War\u2014a war that The Nation forcefully opposed from the outset.\nIn an unsigned editorial, this one published on the eve of Congress\u2019s 2002 vote to authorize the Iraq war, The Nation wrote: \u201cThe silence of those of you in the Democratic Party is especially troubling.\u2026 For the sake of staying in power, you are told, you must not exercise the power you have in the matter of the war. What, then, is the purpose of your reelection?\u201d\nThe same question needs to be asked today.\nThere will be people wondering whom we would endorse, if not Harris. Our answer is that we choose not to endorse any party\u2019s candidate for president. We know that a second Trump presidency would be a disaster, but we believe that we cannot vote our way out of this genocide. And while some of us will be voting for president in November\u2014and some of us will not\u2014we all reject the idea that democracy will be safe under a Harris administration.\nThe systems of oppression in the United States and Israel are linked. It\u2019s no coincidence that FEMA is running low on funds while the federal government sends $17.9 billion to Israel or that the inspirations for Cop City and other vast police training centers are Israeli Urban Warfare Training Centers, which were built with US aid. It\u2019s no coincidence that the same technology that Israel uses to enforce apartheid the US deploys at its southern border, which Harris seems eager to further militarize.\nStill, we want to be clear: In opting not to support Harris, we are not na\u00efve enough to think we can opt out of politics altogether. Instead, we believe we must challenge institutions devoted to the status quo in the US and, crucially, in Israel. There are so many ways to engage.\nWhen it comes to Gaza, you can protest\u2014and keep protesting\u2014until universities and workplaces divest from weapons manufacturers. You can support downballot candidates who support Palestinians. You can shut down highways. Interrupt speeches by war criminals. Boycott institutions and companies that profit from and perpetrate genocide. Give to mutual aid networks in Gaza and Lebanon that attempt to counteract the harm caused by US tax dollars. Don\u2019t just unsubscribe but boycott news outlets that feed the genocidal rhetoric\u2014and tell them why you are unsubscribing. And don\u2019t stop talking about Gaza wherever you are.\nAs journalists, we take this last directive seriously, feeling the weight of the question Palestinian American writer Fargo Tbakhi posed in December: \u201cWhat does Palestine require of us, as writers writing in English from within the imperial core, in this moment of genocide?\u201d We believe that one of the most vital contributions we can make is to confront the media ecosystem that enables\u2014and all too often promotes\u2014the slaughter of Palestinians. Over the last year we\u2019ve seen the spirit of McCarthyism overtake our industry, with journalists being fired or pushed out of newsrooms or barred from covering Palestine for speaking out. Many publications are punishing journalists who have the moral clarity to accurately describe the horrors of the genocide. As long as journalists on the ground in Gaza continue to risk their lives to tell the story of their own annihilation, then the least US outlets can do is follow their lead and not be afraid to show the truth.\nIt is in seeking to follow their lead that we, as journalists, refuse to promote Harris. When we think of her, we do not think of the redemption of American democracy. We think of mangled bodies. Press jackets buried with shredded remains in shoeboxes. Hospital patients, still attached to IVs, burning alive. Grieving mothers wailing until they pass out. The haunted eyes of a Palestinian prisoner. We think of pigtails and lifeless eyes, the smell of rot over mass graves, bodies without heads.\nWe think of ashes, dust, and blood.\nWritten by\u00a0Thomas Birmingham, Xenia\u00a0Gonikberg,\u00a0Kelly Hui,\u00a0Samaa\u00a0Khullar,\u00a0and Grayson Scott.\nSince 1978, The Nation internship has provided opportunities for mentorship, training, networking, and publishing for the next generation of journalists.\n\nIn his weekly newsletter, Elie Mystal lambastes the Republicans\u2019 shameful priorities\u2014and their deadly consequences.\n\n\nElie Mystal \n\nSay their names.\n\n\nSteve Brodner \n\nHere we are, once again learning that the restraints Americans could rely upon in the past are fast disappearing.\n\n\nKaren J.

    "content": "Nearly two-thirds also say Trump often departs from the truth, the poll found.\nHalf the country sees former President Donald Trump as a fascist, amplifying concerns raised in recent days by Vice President Kamala Harris and past members of Trump's own administration. Far fewer in a new ABC News/Ipsos poll level the same charge against Harris.\nNearly two-thirds also say Trump often departs from the truth, again more than say so about Harris. But Harris gets more criticism than Trump for pandering for votes by promoting policies she doesn't intend to carry out -- underscoring challenges for both candidates as the fur flies in their increasingly heated presidential race.\nResponding to one of the more incendiary salvos, 49% of registered voters in the national survey say Trump is a fascist, defined as \"a political extremist who seeks to act as a dictator, disregards individual rights and threatens or uses force against their opponents.\" Fewer than half as many, 22%, see Harris as a fascist by this definition.\nHarris on Wednesday said Trump is a fascist, a week after agreeing with an interviewer that his campaign is \"about fascism.\" A former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a former chief of staff to Trump and a former defense secretary in his administration have been quoted recently also as describing Trump as a fascist, and the White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that President Joe Biden thinks so, too. Trump, for his part, repeatedly has called Harris a fascist, as well as a Marxist and a communist.\nSee PDF for full results.\nResults to this question include 44% who say only Trump is a fascist, 18% who say only Harris is a fascist, and 5% who say both are. Just 32% say neither is a fascist in this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates with fieldwork by Ipsos.\nIt's common for people to think highly negatively of candidates or political figures they oppose, especially in the heat of a presidential campaign. This finding, regardless, marks the divisions -- and the high stakes -- of this particular contest.\nPerceptions of fascism are tied to partisanship: 87% of Democrats call Trump a fascist, compared with 46% of independents and 12% of Republicans. Harris, for her part, is seen as a fascist by 41% of Republicans, 20% of independents and 3% of Democrats.\nIt's similar by candidate support. Eighty-seven percent of registered voters who support Harris for president see Trump as a fascist. Many fewer Trump supporters, 42%, apply the fascist label to Harris. Among registered voters who think Trump is a fascist, 8% support him anyway.\nInterviews for this survey were completed Tuesday, before The New York Times published an interview in which John Kelly, a retired general and former secretary of homeland security and Trump chief of staff, said Trump \"certainly falls into the general definition of fascist, for sure.\"\nTrump also comes in for disproportionate criticism in the truth-telling department. Sixty-five percent of registered voters say he often says things that are not true. Fewer, but still 49%, say the same about Harris. Even among his own supporters, 30% say Trump often speaks untruths.\nHarris gets more criticism on another front. Registered voters by a 15-point margin, 57%-42%, say she mainly is making proposals \"that just are intended to get people to vote for her,\" not that she intends to carry out. Just more than half say the same about Trump, but it's a closer margin, 52%-47%.\nThe two candidates are closer in another gauge -- whether they are mainly trying to explain what they would do as president or mainly trying to avoid explaining this. It's 47%-52% (explain vs. avoid) for Harris and 48%-50% for Trump, hardly a rousing score in either case.\nCriticism of Trump on truth-telling reflects, at least in part, his false claim that Biden did not legitimately win the 2020 election. Registered voters reject this claim by a 2-1 margin, 65%-33% -- and among the two-thirds who say Biden won, 86% say Trump says things that are not true very or somewhat often -- including 72% who say he does this \"very\" often.\nAs with views of fascism, attitudes on the candidates' truth-telling, pandering and avoiding explanations are strongly tied to partisanship and ideology. For example, 95% of Democrats and 93% of liberals think Trump often says things that are not true; 85% of Republicans and 83% of conservatives say the same about Harris.\nStill, Trump gets more criticism on truth-telling in his base than Harris does in hers. Thirty-two percent of Republicans and 38% of conservatives say he often doesn't tell the truth, as do, as noted, 30% of his own supporters. In Harris' case, many fewer Democrats (10%), liberals (12%) or Harris supporters (again 10%) say she often doesn't tell the truth.\nDisproportionate views of Trump as a fascist and a prevaricator don't add up to a much higher sense of crisis if he's elected. Instead, it's high for both candidates: Among registered voters who don't support Trump, 68% say his election would be a crisis for the country. Among those who don't support Harris, almost as many, 64%, say it would be a crisis if she won.\nThe share of non-supporters saying it would be a crisis if Harris were elected is essentially unchanged since late August, though 9 percentage points higher than when asked about Biden in September 2020 (55%). It's been largely steady for Trump since then.\nCrisis concerns are associated with perceptions of fascism. Among non-supporters of Harris who call her a fascist, 84% say it would be a crisis for the country if she were elected. Among those who don't see her as a fascist, fewer, albeit still 51%, think it would be a crisis.\nThe gap is even more striking for Trump. Among his non-supporters, 79% of those who think he's a fascist say his election would be a crisis. That drops to 22% of those who don't see him as a fascist.\nViews on truth-telling are related to crisis concerns as well. Among non-supporters who think Harris or Trump \"very\" often say things that are untrue, about eight in 10 see their respective victories as a crisis. Again this drops sharply among those who think the candidates don't tell the truth less often than that.\nIt's a somewhat weaker relationship on pandering. Seventy-three percent of non-supporters who see Trump as pandering think it would be a crisis if he were elected; it's 68% for Harris.\nThis ABC News/Ipsos poll was conducted online via the probability-based Ipsos KnowledgePanel\u00ae Oct. 18-22, 2024, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 2,808 adults, including 2,392 registered voters. Partisan divisions are 29%-29%-30%, Democrats-Republicans-independents, among all respondents, and 32%-32%-29% among registered voters. Results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2 percentage points, including the design effect, for the full sample and registered voters alike. Sampling error is not the only source of differences in polls.\nThe survey was produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates, with sampling and data collection by Ipsos.

    "content": "For months, VICTOR MARTINEZ has been working to make the case for KAMALA HARRIS to Latinos on his Spanish-language radio show in Pennsylvania’s Lehigh Valley, acutely aware that DONALD TRUMP seemed to be making real inroads. But the calls he received on Monday suggested that there might be an 11th-hour shift in this swing region of the most important Electoral College battleground. The stream of racist invective from Trump’s MAGA rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday broke through, especially with voters from Puerto Rico, which one warm-up speaker described as “a floating island of garbage.” On Monday morning, Martinez, who is of Puerto Rican descent, was flooded with calls, including one from an undecided voter who’d been lukewarm about both presidential candidates until finding out about Sunday’s Trump rally: “They said, ‘I’m voting for Kamala Harris.’” That call, he said, was representative of the broader response. “For Puerto Ricans, this is our October surprise,” Martinez told West Wing Playbook. “This is a gift with a bow from the Trump campaign. This is what we needed to energize the Puerto Rican community, remind the Puerto Rican community of who he is.” Trump’s campaign disavowed — but never repudiated — comedian TONY HINCHCLIFFE’s comments several hours after he made them. But almost from the moment he became a presidential candidate, Trump’s politics have been characterized by nativist and at times racist rhetoric. Given his cultural and political ubiquity, it’s essentially baked in at this point — new articulations of vitriol from the former president or his high-profile supporters barely move the needle with the electorate. And yet, Harris and her team believe Trump’s MSG rally, which drew comparisons to a 1939 Nazi rally in the original Manhattan arena, might be different. Hinchcliffe’s viral remark about Puerto Rico, which drew a strong reaction from several celebrities and even some Republican lawmakers, could spark the same kind of backlash with Latinos as Trump’s reference months earlier to “Black jobs.” Just as the hammer attack on PAUL PELOSI in the days before the 2022 midterms clarified for some the dangers of GOP extremism, the totality of racist and offensive comments by a parade of white, mostly male Trump backers could serve as a final reminder of how hate remains closely associated with his political movement. On Monday, Harris’ operation worked to respond to the Trump rally in surround sound, holding a press conference with surrogates in Philadelphia, cutting a new digital ad highlighting the remarks and having the candidate herself react to the comments early in the day. Harris told reporters that the rally reflected Trump’s own dark appeals to people’s baser instincts. “He is focused and actually fixated on his grievances, on himself and on dividing our country. And it is not in any way something that will strengthen the American family, the American worker,” Harris said on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews before leaving Washington for a day of events in Michigan. “What he did last night is not a discovery. It is just more of the same, and maybe more vivid than usual,” she continued. “Donald Trump spends full time trying to have Americans point their finger at each other, fans the fuel of hatred and division and that’s why people are exhausted with him.” There were all kinds of clips from the rally pinging around the internet on Sunday and into Monday — like former Fox News host TUCKER CARLSON calling Harris a “Samoan-Malaysian, low I.Q., former California prosecutor” (she’s not Samoan or Malaysian), or former adviser STEPHEN MILLER declaring that “America is for Americans — and Americans only.” But, more than anything else, it’s the Puerto Rico remark that could have an impact in the final eight days of the campaign. Harris, in her tarmac gaggle, noted that Hinchcliffe’s remark wasn’t much different than many of Trump’s own recent comments: describing America as a “garbage can,” vowing to root out “the enemy within” and declaring that immigrants are “poisoning the blood” of the country. By that time, a number of Puerto Rican celebrities from BAD BUNNY to LUIS FONSI and JENNIFER LOPEZ had posted on social media — with around 400 million combined followers between them — about Trump’s rally and Hinchcliffe’s disparagement of the island. Bad Bunny, in fact, posted Harris’ own video aimed at Puerto Ricans on his Instagram account (three times!) on Sunday just as Trump’s rally was concluding, later confirming that he was officially backing the vice president’s campaign. NATE SILVER noted in a piece assessing the rally’s impact that Google searches for Hinchcliffe were surpassing those for TAYLOR SWIFT, writing that a final-week news cycle focused largely on Trump and the most unseemly aspects of his movement “could throw Harris a lifeline.” Trump is scheduled to campaign in Allentown, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday. The city’s mayor, MATTHEW TUERK, told West Wing Playbook that the MSG rally on Sunday “was the worst own-goal in history” and might spur the higher turnout among Latinos that Democrats are banking on. “I’ve been talking to a variety of Spanish-language media, and I’ve said to them, this is the wake-up call. Everyone’s doing a double take,” said Tuerk, who is of Cuban descent and the first Latino mayor in Allentown’s history. “I think Puerto Rican voters broadly speaking were leaning toward Harris already or had already voted for her,” he continued. “Anybody who had their doubts, their doubts were based on the economy, maybe some internalized sexism. But I think the people of Allentown, the people of Puerto Rico — we are proud people. When you insult us, it gets our dander up. It pisses us off. We don’t typically mouth off — we take some action.”"

    "content": "Professor of Political Science, University of Nottingham\n    \nTodd Landman receives funding from International Justice Mission, US State Department Trafficking in Persons Office, J. Sainsbury's Ltd., and the US National Institute for Justice. . \n\nUniversity of Nottingham provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation UK.\nView all partners\nAs it moves into the final week, the US election campaign remains so tight that most commentators are calling it a toss-up. But Donald Trump\u2019s campaign may have just dealt itself its own \u201cOctober surprise\u201d \u2013 something no candidate for the US president wants as it stands for a last-minute disaster. \nAt his much anticipated \u201cclosing argument\u201d rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City on October 27, various warm-up speakers engaged in strong, dark rhetoric about the state of the nation that laid the ground for Trump to take the stage and assert his position as the \u201cprotector\u201d,\u201cfixer\u201d, and \u201cliberator\u201d of what he and his support base like to think of as an \u201coccupied\u201d country. \nYou can listen to more articles from The Conversation, narrated by Noa.\nBut the tone and content of the event was problematic from the start. Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe made opening remarks in which he described Puerto Rico as an \u201cisland of garbage\u201d. \nDeep offence at these remarks rippled across America\u2019s Puerto Rican community and beyond. His slur on Puerto Rico drew condemnation across the political spectrum and mobilised a rash of new endorsements for the Harris-Walz campaign. The incident has raised the prospect of a Puerto Rican backlash that could well have an impact on the outcome of the election.\nCausing such deep offence to a significant minority population at a crucial moment in the campaign could have real consequences. Ultimately, the outcome of the election is determined by electoral college votes. These, in the end, will rely heavily on tallies across seven swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. \nThe outcome of the 2016 and 2020 elections, although the Democrats received far more votes than the Republicans in total (3 million and 7 million, respectively), came down to very close margins across these swing states. In 2020, Joe Biden won the electoral college vote across these seven states \u2013 but with an average of less than half a percentage point (0.47%).\nPuerto Rico is what is known as an \u201cunincorporated territory\u201d of the United States. Since it is not a state, it does not have any electoral college votes. But Puerto Ricans are citizens of the United States \u2013 a status they have enjoyed since 1917 \u2013 and can move freely between Puerto Rico and the mainland. \nThose who reside in Puerto Rico may not vote in federal elections, but those who do live in the United States are eligible to vote in the states where they are registered.  \nHistorically Puerto Ricans have been more likely to support the Democrats. But their turnout has been in consistent in the past. And both campaigns have made special effort to target this group. If enough people take offence at Hinchcliffe\u2019s remarks, this could have a significant impact on the election result.\nMillions of Puerto Ricans have made successful lives and careers in the US. As of 2021, Puerto Ricans make up 2% of the US population (5.8 million, up from 4.7 million in 2010). Despite this relatively low percentage overall, it is the distribution of the Puerto Rican population that makes them important in the presidential election.\nThe table below shows the Puerto Rican population across swing states in 2024 as well as the number of electoral college votes that are up for grabs in each state and the winning vote margin for Joe Biden in 2020. The figures in the table are for the whole Puerto Rican population. \nAcross these seven swing states, it is clear that the distribution of Puerto Ricans is not insignificant. This is especially the case in the key state of Pennsylvania.

    "content": "The Trump campaign is struggling to contain an October surprise of its own making, just one week from Election Day. A racist remark by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, one of many warm-up speakers for former President Trump at a Sunday rally in New York’s Madison Square Garden, is reverberating hard. Vice President Harris and other Democrats are working to make sure the gibe reaches the ears of as many Latino voters as possible — especially in the swing states that will decide the election. Republicans, including Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance (Ohio), are trying to minimize the damage — either by distancing themselves from what Hinchcliffe said or by suggesting that a remark made in jest should not spark such outrage. At the rally, Hinchcliffe referred to Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage.” He also used other racist tropes including a reference to Black people and watermelons, and a crude reference linking procreation and immigration. The comments were slammed as offensive in their own right. But they could also have serious electoral repercussions. More than 400,000 people born in Puerto Rico or of Puerto Rican descent live in Pennsylvania, the largest of the seven battleground states. The state is essentially deadlocked, with Trump leading Harris by just four-tenths of a percentage point in the polling average maintained by The Hill/Decision Desk HQ. There are also tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans in other swing states, including Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina. Democratic operative Chuck Rocha, an expert on the Latino vote, told this column that he and a super PAC he advises, Nuestro PAC, had sent clips of Hinchcliffe’s remarks “to every Puerto Rican voter in Pennsylvania” on Monday. Referring to the uproar and its effect on Trump’s campaign, Rocha added, “It’s an unforced error from a campaign that has no strategic vision. Puerto Rican voters are very sensitive about their island and how you talk about their island — whether they themselves live on that island or in Allentown.” Allentown, about 50 miles north of Philadelphia, is described by The Philadelphia Inquirer as “a majority Latino city and home to 34,000 Puerto Ricans — the eighth-largest Puerto Rican community in America.” Harris has been turning the screws on Trump over the remark. The vice president on Monday cited Trump’s New York event as having “highlighted a point that I’ve been making throughout this campaign. … He is focused and actually fixated on his grievances, on himself and on dividing our country.” Her campaign also launched a digital ad aimed at Latino voters that began with Hinchcliffe’s words and asserted that “Puerto Ricans deserve better.” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who is of Puerto Rican descent, described the Madison Square Garden rally as a “hate rally” during an interview on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Monday morning. On social media, Ocasio-Cortez hit back at Hinchcliffe’s defense that “these people have no sense of humor” and that his joke had been “taken out of context to make it seem racist.” The New York congresswoman accused the comic of “feeding red-meat racism alongside a throng of other bigots to a frothing crowd.” The reaction from the Trump campaign — and from the GOP more broadly — suggests they are well aware of the potential damage from the furor. Trump campaign senior adviser Danielle Alvarez told media outlets that the comic’s comments did not “reflect the views” of the former president or his campaign. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), whose state is home to more than 1 million people of Puerto Rican descent, responded almost instantly to the controversy Sunday evening, with a post on the social platform X saying the joke was “not funny and it’s not true.” Scott added that Puerto Ricans are “amazing people and amazing Americans.” Also on social media, Rep. Anthony D’Esposito (R-N.Y.) noted he was “proud to be Puerto Rican,” adding “the only thing that’s ‘garbage’ was a bad comedy set.” Meanwhile, Vance said at a rally Monday that he had “heard about” though not “seen” Hinchcliffe’s joke, but that he was “so over” people taking offense easily. To be sure, it’s possible that the furor does not dent Trump’s chances. The former president has not yet weighed in on the matter directly, but he could disavow the comments or simply hope that the controversy fades, as so many revolving around him have done in the past. The Trump campaign continues to believe it can do better with Latino voters, especially young men, than GOP nominees have done in the recent past. Pro-Trump voices contend there are economic and cultural reasons why Latinos are drawn to his platform. But Democrats counter that the Puerto Rico controversy is especially potent for several reasons: the swing states’ demographics, the capacity of other non-Puerto Rican Latinos to take offense at the remarks, and of course the proximity to Election Day. According to José Parra, a Democratic strategist and a former senior adviser to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.): “If Pennsylvania swings toward the Democrats, I think you can look back on this as a pivotal moment.”"

    "content": "A comedian at a Donald Trump rally called Puerto Rico a \"floating island of garbage\", sparking fury from Republicans and Democrats and accusations of racism.\nThe comic, Tony Hinchcliffe, was among the speakers at the Madison Square Garden in New York on Sunday. He also made a series of jokes that leant on racist stereotypes.\nA Trump adviser distanced the former president from the Puerto Rico joke, which was also denounced by Trump's Democratic rival, Kamala Harris. Harris herself was the target of another Trump warm-up speaker who also sparked controversy.\nThe furore came as one of the world's top Latin celebrities, Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny, endorsed Harris for president.\nIn his joke, Hinchcliffe, known for his comedy podcast Kill Tony, said: \"There\u2019s a lot going on. I don\u2019t know if you know this but there\u2019s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it\u2019s called Puerto Rico.\"\nThe line appeared to meet a mixed reception. Two Republicans in the state of Florida, which has a prominent Puerto Rican population, were among those who called out the joke.\nUS congresswoman Maria Elvira Salazar said she was \"disgusted\" by the \"racist comment\". She said on X that it did not \"reflect the GOP values\", referring to the Republican Party, and noted thousands of Puerto Ricans served in the military. \nUS Senator Rick Scott said: \"The joke bombed for a reason. It's not funny and it's not true.\" He added that \"Puerto Ricans are amazing people and amazing Americans\".\nPuerto Rico is a US island territory in the Caribbean. Its residents are unable to vote in US presidential elections, but there is a large diaspora across the US who can.\nHinchcliffe also suggested Latinos \"loved making babies\".\nHe drew on racist tropes about black people and watermelons, which prompted groans from the audience - and he called Palestinians rock-throwers while in the same sentence suggested Jews would not spend money - invoking an antisemitic trope.\nAccording to the BBC's US partner CBS, a source familiar with the event confirmed that the Trump campaign vetted Hinchcliffe's list of jokes - but the comments about Puerto Rico, Latinos and black people were ad-libbed. The campaign also said it cut two profane jokes. \nTrump himself has remained silent on the row. He has faced calls to apologise from the archbishop of Puerto Rico and the head of the island's Republican Party, among others.\nMr Hinchcliffe defended his material after the backlash. \"These people have no sense of humour,\" he wrote on X in response to criticism from Democratic lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz.\nThe comedian added: \"I love Puerto Rico and vacation there. I made fun of everyone\u2026 watch the whole set.\" \nOcasio-Cortez responded: \"You don't 'love Puerto Rico'. You like drinking pi\u00f1a coladas. There's a difference.\" She had earlier said Hinchcliffe's comments were \"super upsetting\", noting that her family was from Puerto Rico. \nThe night's other speakers courted controversy with their own remarks. David Rem, a childhood friend of Trump, called Harris \"the devil\" and \"the antichrist\". \nAnd Trump's former lawyer Rudy Giuliani falsely claimed the Democratic candidate was \"on the side of the terrorists\" in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nAlthough much of the focus was on the comments by his guest speakers, Trump used the occasion to announce a plan for tax credits for those who take care of a parent or a loved one. \"It's about time that they were recognised,\" he said.\nHe also reiterated plans for a mass deportation for illegal migrants, speaking of his wish to \"rescue\" places that had been \"invaded and conquered\" by \"vicious and bloodthirsty criminals\".\nEarlier on Sunday, Harris unveiled policies aimed at helping those in Puerto Rico - garnering support from Jennifer Lopez, who has Puerto Rican parents, as well as Bad Bunny. Numerous other big-name celebrities have already backed her.\nBad Bunny posted multiple videos of Harris talking about the island, her ideas to help residents, and her attacks on how Trump handled Hurricane Maria as president when the deadly storm killed nearly 3,000 people there in 2017.\nA source close to Bad Bunny confirmed to CBS that this represented an endorsement of Harris, breaking his longstanding tradition of not weighing in on national politics.\nIn the last seven years, there has been an exodus from Puerto Rico, whose inhabitants have moved to the mainland US including Florida and swing states such as North Carolina, Georgia and Pennsylvania. Puerto Ricans are now reportedly the second largest Latino subgroup in those states.\nBad Bunny's comments appeared to be pre-planned, and he did not address the remarks by Hinchcliffe. But fellow Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin did, telling his fans \"this is what they think of us\" and urging them to vote for Harris. \nThere are around 36 million Hispanic voters eligible to vote this year, according to the Pew Research centre. They have generally formed a key plank of the Democratic coalition but Republicans have been eating into that support.\nMadison Square Garden, near the heart of the city, is one of the most famous venues in the world and capable of seating about 20,000.\nIt is also in Trump's hometown, and the city in which he landed a historic criminal conviction earlier this year. \nNew York - viewed by some as a curious choice for the final week of campaigning - is a solid blue state and will not be decisive in the race for the White House.\nTony Hinchcliffe is a stand-up comedian based in Austin, Texas, known for his podcast Kill Tony, which offers stand up comedians the opportunity to audition for 60 seconds before Hinchcliffe and his co-host, Brian Redban.\nThe podcast has 1.89 million subscribers on YouTube.\nThe comedian grew up in Youngstown, Ohio, and described himself as \"the class clown\".  He got his start in the comedy world working for Joe Rogan and writing jokes for celebrities on Comedy Central Roast.\nThis is not the first time some of his comments have made headlines for their offensive nature.\nIn 2021, he used a racial slur when referring to American-Chinese comedian Peng Deng during a comedy set and refused to apologise.\n\"I knew that what I had done was not wrong,\u201d Hinchcliffe said when asked by Variety about that controversy.  \"It was so dumbfounding to me because it was a joke, and my stance is that comedians should never apologise for a joke.\"\nHinchcliffe was one of the comedians who appeared on former NFL star Tom Brady's Netflix comedy roast earlier this year.\nAdditional reporting by James FitzGerald and Ana Faguy\nNorth America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his weekly US Election Unspun newsletter. \nReaders in the US can sign up here.

Inconsistencies may occur.\nEnrollment for Affordable Care Act coverage begins on November 1, but House Speaker Mike Johnson has cast doubt on the ACA's future, saying it could be abolished if Donald Trump wins next week's presidential election.\nThe ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in March 2010, with the goal of expanding access to and reducing costs for health insurance. More than 49 million Americans have been covered by the ACA in the past decade, the White House reported in September.\nAt a rally in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, on Monday, Johnson said health care reform would be a \"big part of the agenda\" for a second Trump presidency. \"When I say we're going to have a very aggressive first 100 days agenda, we got a lot of things still on the table,\" he added.\nOne event attendee asked Johnson, \"No Obamacare?\" The speaker replied: \"No Obamacare. The ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\"\nJohnson's comments came days before the open enrollment period for ACA health plans, during which eligible Americans can look for new coverage or make changes to their plans. The period ends on January 15 for most states.\nNewsweek contacted Johnson's office for comment via email outside regular working hours.\nTrump himself has touted getting rid of the ACA, saying during the September 10 presidential debate that he had \"the concepts of a plan\" for doing away with Obamacare. While president, Trump attempted to repeal the act, but his efforts were rejected by Congress. Following his presidency, the Supreme Court struck down a lawsuit claiming the ACA was unconstitutional.\nStill, Trump has persisted in his vow to undo the ACA. In a November 2023 post on Truth Social, he wrote: \"I don't want to terminate Obamacare, I want to REPLACE IT with MUCH BETTER HEALTHCARE. Obamacare Sucks!!!\"\nEarlier this month, more than 1,500 physicians nationwide signed an open letter urging Trump to disclose specifics regarding his proposed changes to the act.\n\"Our patients, and all Americans, deserve more than just a 'concept of a plan,' because concepts don't pay for medical bills,\" said Dr. Rob Davidson, the executive director of the Committee to Protect Health Care and an emergency physician in west Michigan.\nNewsweek contacted Trump's campaign for clarification on his replacement plans for the ACA.\nVice President Kamala Harris, Trump's Democratic opponent, has campaigned on a vow to protect Obamacare. \"What we need to do is maintain and grow the Affordable Care Act,\" Harris said during the September debate.\n\"Trump wants to 'terminate' the Affordable Care Act, and go back to the time when 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions like cancer, diabetes, or asthma could be denied coverage, or charged thousands more,\" the Harris campaign said in August.\nThe Biden-Harris administration said in September: \"We know Republican officials will stop at nothing to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, ripping health coverage away from Americans in every part of our country.

    "content": "If former President Donald Trump returns to the White House, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., says he will take another swing at repealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA), legislation that was enacted by former President Barack Obama in 2010 to expand health care coverage to poorer and middle-class Americans. In its place, he proposed \"massive reform,\" but did not offer details on what they would entail.\n\u201cHealth care reform\u2019s going to be a big part of the agenda. When I say we\u2019re going to have a very aggressive first 100 days agenda, we got a lot of things still on the table,\u201d Johnson said at a campaign event for GOP House candidate Ryan Mackenzie in Pennsylvania.\n\u201cNo Obamacare?\u201d an attendee asked Johnson, using the shorthand name for the ACA.\n\u201cNo Obamacare,\u201d Johnson responded, rolling his eyes. \u201cThe ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\u201d\nRelated\nRepublicans have long been fixated on repealing Obamacare since the moment it was passed, even as it remains popular among Americans. Trump and the GOP congress nearly succeeded in 2017 but were thwarted by three Republican defections during the Senate vote. Recently, Trump proclaimed his desire to reopen the fight.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to terminate Obamacare, I want to REPLACE IT with MUCH BETTER HEALTHCARE.

The speaker said Republicans want to \"take a blowtorch to the regulatory state\" and \"fix things\" in the health care sector.\nHealth care is a key issue in the 2024 election and both parties have different views on the ACA, which set minimum benefit standards, allowed more people to be eligible for Medicaid and ensured consumers with preexisting conditions could have health care coverage.\n\"Health care reform is going to be a big part of the agenda. When I say we're going to have a very aggressive first 100 days agenda, we got a lot of things still on the table,\" he said.\nThe speaker said \"if you take government bureaucrats out of the health care equation and you have a doctor patient relationship it is better for everybody, more efficient more effective.

Spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement, \"Speaker Mike Johnson is making it clear \u2013 if Donald Trump wins, he and his Project 2025 allies in Congress will make sure there is 'no Obamacare.' That means higher health care costs for millions of families and ripping away protections from Americans with preexisting conditions like diabetes, asthma, or cancer. Voters see Trump's 'concepts of a plan' for what they are: Ending the Affordable Care Act, jacking up prices, and leaving millions of Americans without the care they need.\"\nFormer President Donald Trump's campaign quickly tried to separate itself from the speaker's comments.

On Monday, the speaker said at an event in Pennsylvania that Republicans are \u201cgoing to have a very aggressive first 100 days agenda\u201d if Donald Trump is re-elected, with health care reform being \u201ca big part\u201d of it, NBC News first reported.

The ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\u201d\nDemocrats took Johnson\u2019s remarks as a vow to repeal the law should Trump return to the White House. The Harris campaign warned that health care is on the ballot, adding, \u201cSpeaker Mike Johnson is making it clear \u2014 if Donald Trump wins, he and his Project 2025 allies in Congress will make sure there is \u2018no Obamacare.\u2019\u201d\nEven Trump\u2019s campaign distanced itself from Johnson\u2019s comment. \u201cRepealing Obamacare is not President Trump\u2019s policy position,\u201d campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said.\nRepublicans have long criticized the Affordable Care Act and, as president, Trump made a number of failed attempts to undo it. The Supreme Court has also repeatedly upheld the law. Despite the campaign\u2019s efforts to keep Johnson\u2019s sentiments at arm\u2019s length, it\u2019s entirely plausible that Trump could seek to repeal the ACA again.

But there may be an early November surprise lurking.\nHOUSE SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON has been hinting for the past week that he is preparing a post-election surprise: a \u201cmassive reform\u201d of Obamacare.\nTHIS COULD BE A CATASTROPHIC GAFFE since Obamacare polls extremely well \u2014 60% or better in most surveys. If Johnson is hinting that there will be cuts in Obamacare spending, that could be a political disaster for the GOP.\nREPUBLICANS IN THIS TOWN are attempting to dissuade Johnson from any comments on Obamacare, just as Democrats are trying to muzzle the hopelessly gaffe-prone Biden.\nTHESE CONTROVERSIES could move the needle a bit with Hispanics, and with voters who want their health care.

Harris still needs an upset in North Carolina, in our opinion.\nDOES HARRIS STILL HAVE A CHANCE?

    "content": "Profile\nSections\nLocal\ntv\nFeatured\nMore From NBC\nFollow NBC News\n news Alerts\nThere are no new alerts at this time\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris said Wednesday she strongly disagrees with criticisms of groups of people based on the candidate they support. Her remarks came after President Joe Biden came under fire the night before for his reaction to a comedian's racist joke at a rally for former President Donald Trump.\nSpeaking to reporters on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, before leaving for campaign events, Harris said that Biden had \"clarified his comments,\" but added, \"I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they voted for.\"\nDuring a video call for Latino voter outreach on Tuesday, Biden appeared to criticize either Trump supporters or comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who referred to Puerto Rico as a \"floating island of garbage\" among other racist jokes at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday.\n\u201cThey\u2019re good, decent, honorable people,\u201d Biden said, referring to the Puerto Rican community. \u201cThe only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it\u2019s un-American. It\u2019s totally contrary to everything we\u2019ve done.\u201d\nThe White House spokesman Andrew Bates quickly put out a statement that Biden \u201creferred to the hateful rhetoric at the Madison Square Garden rally as garbage.\u201d\nThe White House also sent around a transcript in an attempt to show that Biden was not saying that Trump supporters were \u201cgarbage\u201d but that he tripped over his lines and meant to say he was condemning Hinchcliffe\u2019s remarks specifically.\nThe transcript quotes Biden as saying: \"And just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a 'floating island of garbage.'\u00a0Well, let me tell you something.\u00a0I don\u2019t \u2014 I \u2014 I don\u2019t know the Puerto Rican that \u2014 that I know \u2014 or a Puerto Rico, where I\u2019m fr- \u2014 in my home state of Delaware, they\u2019re good, decent, honorable people.\u00a0The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter\u2019s \u2014 his \u2014 his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it\u2019s un-American.\u00a0It\u2019s totally contrary to everything we\u2019ve done, everything we\u2019ve been.\"\nIn a post on X later Tuesday, Biden also said he was referring to Hinchcliffe.\nBiden's comment came shortly before Harris delivered a closing argument speech at the Ellipse in Washington, promising to \"turn the page on the drama and the conflict\" of the Trump era and give people who disagree with her \"a seat at the table.\"\n\"Unlike Donald Trump, I don\u2019t believe people who disagree with me are the enemy,\" she said. \"He wants to put them in jail. I\u2019ll give them a seat at the table.\"\nHarris sought to double down on her message of unity Wednesday, telling reporters: \"I believe that the work that I do is about representing all the people, whether they support me or not. And\u00a0as president of the United States, I will be a president for all Americans, whether you vote for me or not.\"\nShe added, \"I respect the fact that we all have so much more in common than what separates us, and that most people want a president that understands that, that gets that and approaches their role of leadership that way.\"\nShe said that she spoke to Biden on Tuesday night but that they did not discuss his remark.\nHarris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, defended Biden in interviews Wednesday morning, saying that the president had clarified his remarks. He also echoed Harris' unity messaging. \u201cI have made it absolutely clear that we want everyone as a part of this,\u201d Walz said during an interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America.\"\n\u201cPresident Biden was very clear that he\u2019s speaking about the rhetoric we heard at that [rally] so it doesn\u2019t undermine it,\" Walz said on \"CBS Mornings.\" \"People are hungry to come back together. They\u2019re hungry to find a unifying message. They\u2019re hungry for us to find solutions, whether it\u2019s prices or whether it\u2019s reproductive care, they want to see solutions.\"\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre defended Biden at the press Wednesday. \u201cHe was not calling Trump supporters garbage, which is why he put out this is why he wanted to make sure that we put out a statement that clarified what he meant and what he was trying to say,\u201d she said. \u201cHateful rhetoric, hateful rhetoric that he hears and this is something that we\u2019ve done many times from here, we\u2019ll call that out.\u201d\nSome Democrats, including Rep. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, have criticized Biden\u2019s remark.\n\u201cNo politician should be talking about anybody that way. Doesn\u2019t matter who they are,\u201d Gallego, who is running in a competitive Senate race against Republican Kari Lake in the battleground state, told reporters after a campaign stop in Phoenix on Wednesday.\nHarris has sought to walk a fine line in criticizing Trump while not alienating his supporters, pointing to Trump's divisive rhetoric. During an interview this month on Fox News, anchor Bret Baier asked Harris if she thought Trump voters were stupid.\n\"Oh god, I would never say that about the American people,\" she said. \"And in fact, if you listen to Donald Trump, if you watch any of his rallies, he\u2019s the one who tends to demean and belittle and diminish the American people.\"\nAmong Trump's comments that Harris and her allies have pointed to are him repeatedly calling Democrats and his opponents \u201cthe enemy from within\u201d and referring to the U.S. as a \u201cgarbage can.\u201d Trump has also said that Jewish people who vote Democrat \u201cshould have their head examined\u201d and suggested that he could use the military against the \"radical left.\"\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have pounced on Biden's comments to attack Harris and her campaign. At an event in North Carolina on Wednesday, Trump said, \"My response to Joe and Kamala is very simple. You can't lead America if you don't love Americans. You just can\u2019t. And you can't be president if you hate the American people, and there's a lot of hatred there.\"\nStephanie\u00a0Cutter, a senior adviser on messaging for the Harris-Walz campaign, said in an interview on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Wednesday that people should focus their outrage instead on Trump.\n\u201cSpare me the faux outrage from Donald Trump, JD Vance, and his campaign,\" she said. \"Even as they\u2019re trying to argue that President Biden is disparaging Trump voters, the president is calling the entire country a trash can.\"\nRebecca Shabad is a politics reporter for NBC News based in Washington.\n\u00a9\u00a02025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

That's all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don't reflect who we are as a nation.\"\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at a briefing that Biden \"does not view Trump supporters or anybody who supports Trump, as garbage\".\nBut Trump's backers have seized upon the comments, making comparisons with a controversial remark by Hillary Clinton in 2016 during Trump's first run for office, when she said half of Trump's supporters were from a \"basket of deplorables\".\nAs the war of words escalated, Trump himself suggested Kamala Harris - his rival for the White House - was running a \"campaign of hate\". \nDemocrats have in turn criticised Trump for railing at his own rallies against \"the enemy from within\", which he has said refers to \"radical left lunatics\" and a couple of Democratic lawmakers.\nAt his rally in North Carolina on Wednesday, Trump said Biden's words were \"worse\" than what Clinton said.\n\"You know what's worse than anything? Garbage, We're garbage\" he said, going on to praise his supporters as the \"heart and soul of America\".\nAsked about the remark on Wednesday, Harris said Biden had \"clarified his comments\", adding: \"Let me be clear, I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for.\"\nFollow live coverage of the US election\nHarris or Trump: Who's leading the polls?\nListen: Americast on the Puerto Rico \"garbage\" row\nPuerto Ricans in swing state say Trump rally joke won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be forgotten\nBiden's comments on the furore threatened to overshadow a rally on Tuesday evening by Kamala Harris, who is running for the White House as the Democratic nominee after Biden pulled out earlier in the contest. \nHarris delivered what her campaign has called her \"closing argument\" in Washington DC - at the spot from which Trump spoke shortly before a riot by his supporters at the US Capitol building on 6 January 2021.\nShe urged voters to \"turn the page on the drama and the conflict\" in American politics.\nThe Madison Square Garden rally referred to by Biden - during which Hinchcliffe and others sparked offence with a range of comments - was defended on Tuesday by Trump as a \"lovefest\".\nHe acknowledged that \"somebody said some bad things\", but said he did not think it was \"a big deal\".\nTrump stopped short of issuing an apology demanded by prominent figures from the island itself, which is a US territory.

Inconsistencies may occur.\nPresident Joe Biden's remark apparently calling Donald Trump's supporters \"garbage\" quickly brought a backlash, but experts told Newsweek it is unlikely to have much of an impact on the election.\nThe president made the comment in response to a comedian who called Puerto Rico a \"floating island of garbage\" at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally in New York City, where some speakers made crude and racist remarks on Sunday.\nPuerto Ricans are \"good, decent honorable people,\" Biden said on a call organized by Voto Latino, a grassroots advocacy organization, on Tuesday.\n\"The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,\" he said in a reference to Trump, according to the White House transcript of Biden's remarks. \"His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it's un-American.\"\nWhite House spokesman Andrew Bates told Newsweek that Biden was referring \"to the hateful rhetoric at the Madison Square Garden rally as 'garbage.'\"\nBiden also took to social media to clarify his remarks. \"Earlier today, I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump's [supporters] at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage \u2014 which is the only word I can think of to describe it,\" he wrote on X (formerly Twitter). \"His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That's all I meant to say.\"\nTrump and others have compared the remark to then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's comment in 2016 that half of Trump's supporters could be placed in a \"basket of deplorables\" during a private fundraiser. Her remark became a rallying cry for many of Trump's supporters.\nIn September, Clinton acknowledged in an opinion piece in The Washington Post that her choice of words had been \"unfortunate and bad politics.\" But she added that \"'deplorable' is too kind a word for the hate and violent extremism we've seen from some Trump supporters.\"\nTrump and his campaign have sought to tie Biden's \"garbage\" comment to Vice President Kamala Harris, who is trying to win over a broad base of voters\u2014including moderate Republicans\u2014ahead of November's election. \"I pledge to be a president for all Americans and to always put country above party and self,\" she said in a speech billed as her campaign's closing argument at the Ellipse, near the White House, on Tuesday night.\nShe told reporters on Wednesday that she \"strongly\" disagrees with \"any criticism of people based on who they vote for\" and noted that Biden had clarified his remarks. \"You've heard my speech last night and continuously throughout my career. I believe that the work I do is about representing all the people, whether they support me or not,\" she said.\nCostas Panagopoulos, a political science professor at Northeastern University, said Biden's remark is unlikely to have the impact that Clinton's did in 2016.\n\"The MAGA base is already locked in. This is unlikely to have much impact with them,\" he told Newsweek.\n\"Biden has already walked back his comment, but perhaps more importantly, and unlike Hillary Clinton in 2016, he is not the candidate,\" he continued. \"Campaigns can still be held to account for what surrogates say and do on the trail, but only to a certain extent. Ultimately, the candidates' words and actions matter much more.\"\nGrant Davis Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University, said Biden's comment did remind him of Clinton's \"deplorables\" remark.\n\"But at this point, given all we've heard from both sides for eight years, from 's***hole countries' to 'fascist' and 'Hitler,' I don't think this adds anything new,\" he told Newsweek.\n\"Most voters are discounting Biden at this point and focusing on Harris. So more than anything else I think it's just another moment to file in the political polarization and dysfunctional political dialogue folder. Given the context, this does not rise to an October surprise event,\" Reeher said.\nBiden's comment \"was highly ill-advised, to put it mildly,\" Thomas Gift, an associate professor of political science and director of the Centre on U.S. Politics at University College London, told Newsweek.\n\"Still, it's doubtful the comment will have a big negative impact on Kamala Harris' electoral chances,\" he continued. \"The difference with Hillary Clinton's 'basket of deplorables' remark in 2016 was that she was the candidate that year, whereas Joe Biden now isn't. Harris can't be held accountable for everything her boss says, and as long as she distances herself from the comment, that should be enough damage control.\"\nThe Harris campaign has been contacted via email for comment.\nTrump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt cited an earlier statement when contacted for comment.\n\"There's no way to spin it: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris don't just hate President Trump, they despise the tens of millions of Americans who support him,\" Leavitt told Newsweek. Harris \"does not deserve four more years. President Trump will be a president for ALL Americans.\"\nThe Trump campaign sent out an email to supporters that said Biden \"just insulted tens of millions of Americans. Will Kamala apologize and disavow Joe Biden's remarks?\"\nTrump had initially told his supporters to forgive Biden for the comment but has since used it to attack Harris.\nHarris \"has spent all week comparing her political opponents to the most evil mass murderers in history. Now, on top of everything, Joe Biden calls our supporters 'garbage,'\" Trump wrote on X and Truth Social.\n\"You can't lead America if you don't love the American People. Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have shown they are both unfit to be President of the United States,\" he said.\nDuring a CNN town hall, Harris said she believes Trump is a \"fascist.\" This came after John Kelly, Trump's longest-serving chief of staff, said Trump met the definition of the word and would govern like a dictator if allowed to, according to an interview with The New York Times.\nUpdate 10/30/24, 10:55 a.m. ET: This article has been updated to include Vice President Kamala Harris' comments.\nKhaleda Rahman is Newsweek's National Correspondent based in London, UK.

All Rights Reserved.\nPresident Joe Biden speaks during an event about his Investing in America agenda, Tuesday, Oct. 29, 2024, at the Dundalk Marine Terminal in Baltimore. (AP Photo/Daniel Kucin Jr.)\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 White House press officials altered the official transcript of a call in which President Joe Biden appeared to take a swipe at supporters of Donald Trump, drawing objections from the federal workers who document such remarks for posterity, according to two U.S. government officials and an internal email obtained Thursday by The Associated Press.\nBiden created an uproar earlier this week with his remarks to Latino activists responding to racist comments at a Trump rally made by the comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who referred to the U.S. island territory of Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage.\u201d\nBiden, according to a transcript prepared by the official White House stenographers, told the Latino group on a Tuesday evening video call, \u201cThe only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters \u2014 his \u2014 his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it\u2019s un-American.\u201d\nThe transcript released by the White House press office, however, rendered the quote with an apostrophe, reading \u201csupporter\u2019s\u201d rather than \u201csupporters,\u201d which aides said pointed to Biden criticizing Hinchcliffe, not the millions of Americans who are supporting Trump for president.\nThe change was made after the press office \u201cconferred with the president,\u201d according to an internal email from the head of the stenographers\u2019 office that was obtained by The AP. The authenticity of the email was confirmed by two government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters. \n\n\nThe supervisor, in the email, called the press office\u2019s handling of the matter \u201ca breach of protocol and spoliation of transcript integrity between the Stenography and Press Offices.\u201d\n\u201cIf there is a difference in interpretation, the Press Office may choose to withhold the transcript but cannot edit it independently,\u201d the supervisor wrote, adding, \u201cOur Stenography Office transcript \u2014 released to our distro, which includes the National Archives \u2014 is now different than the version edited and released to the public by Press Office staff.\u201d\nThe edit of the transcript came as the White House scrambled to respond to a wave of queries from reporters about Biden\u2019s comments. The president\u2019s remarks clashed with Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 near-simultaneous speech outside the White House in which she called for treating Americans of differing ideologies with respect.\nThe Trump campaign quickly moved to fundraise off the quote, and the next day, Trump himself held a photo op inside a garbage truck to try to capitalize on Biden\u2019s criticism.\nWhat to know about the 2024 election:\nNews outlets globally count on the AP for accurate U.S. election results. Since 1848, the AP has been calling races up and down the ballot. Support us. Donate to the AP.\nHarris on Wednesday distanced herself from Biden\u2019s comments \u2014 making the clearest break from the president since she took over for him at the top of the Democratic ticket just over three months ago. \u201cLet me be clear,\u201d she told reporters, \u201cI strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for.\u201d\nAccording to the email, the press office had asked the stenographers to quickly produce a transcript of the call amid the firestorm. Biden himself took to social media to say that he he was not calling all Trump supporters garbage and that he was referring specifically to the \u201chateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump\u2019s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally.\u201d\nThe stenographers office is charged with preparing accurate transcripts of public and private remarks of the president for preservation by the National Archives and distribution to the public.\nThe two-person stenography team on duty that evening \u2014 a \u201ctyper\u201d and \u201cproofer\u201d \u2014 said any edit to the transcript would have to be approved by their supervisor, the head of stenographers\u2019 office. \nThe supervisor was not immediately available to review the audio, but the press office went ahead and published the altered transcript on the White House website and distributed it to press and on social media in an effort to tamp down the story.\nWhite House senior deputy press secretary Andrew Bates that evening also posted on X the edited version of the quote and wrote that Biden was referring \u201dto the hateful rhetoric at the Madison Square Garden rally as \u2018garbage.\u2019\u201d\nThe supervisor, a career employee of the White House, raised the concerns about the press office action \u2014 but did not weigh in on the accuracy of the edit \u2014 in an email to White House communications director Ben LaBolt, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and other press and communications officials. \n\u201cRegardless of urgency, it is essential to our transcripts\u2019 authenticity and legitimacy that we adhere to consistent protocol for requesting edits, approval, and release,\u201d the supervisor wrote.\nThe supervisor declined to comment to The AP and referred questions about the matter to the White House press office.\nAsked to comment, Bates did not address the alteration of the transcript and said: \u201cThe President confirmed in his tweet on Tuesday evening that he was addressing the hateful rhetoric from the comedian at Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally. That was reflected in the transcript.\u201d\nKaroline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokeswoman, said the White House \u201cunethically altered an official White House transcript in a failed attempt to edit the truth.\u201d\n\u201cJoe Biden called more than half the country \u2018garbage\u2019 and the Harris-Biden Administration cannot be trusted,\u201d she added. \u201cPresident Trump will fix it.\u201d\nHouse Republicans, meanwhile, were debating launching an investigation into the matter. House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and House Oversight and Accountability Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., on Wednesday accused White House staff of \u201creleasing a false transcript\u201d of Biden\u2019s remarks.\nIn a letter to White House counsel Ed Siskel on Wednesday, they called on the administration to retain documents and internal communications related to Biden\u2019s remarks and the release of the transcript.\n\u201cWhite House staff cannot rewrite the words of the President of the United States to be more politically on message,\u201d the lawmakers wrote to Siskel.\nStefanik and Comer said the action could be in violation of the Presidential Records Act of 1978.\n\u2014\nMadhani reported from Las Vegas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

    "content": "Watch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  October 31, 2024 / 7:31 PM EDT\n          / CBS News\n        \nFormer President Donald Trump said Wednesday at a campaign rally that \"whether the women like it or not,\" he will \"protect\" them, noting that his advisers had instructed him not to use the line, which he said they deemed \"inappropriate.\"\nSpeaking near Green Bay, Wisconsin, Trump tried to hammer the Biden-Harris administration on immigration, saying they had \u00a0\"imported criminal migrants\" to enter the country and to \"assault, rape and murder our women and girls.\" He then added that \"anyone who would let monsters kidnap and kill our children does not belong anywhere near the Oval Office.\"\nThe former president then described how he would \"protect\" women, though he noted that his team had urged him against using the line.\n\"My people told me about four weeks ago, I would say 'no, I want to protect the people. I want to protect the women of our country. I want to protect the women,'\" Trump said, describing how his advisers said it would be \"very inappropriate for you to say.\"\u00a0\n\"I said, 'Well, I'm going to do it, whether the women like it or not, I'm going to protect them,'\" Trump said.\u00a0\nTrump went on to ask the crowd, to applause, \"is there any woman in this giant stadium who would like not to be protected? Is there any woman in this stadium that wants to be protected by the president?\"\u00a0\nHarris responded Thursday morning to Trump's comments, telling reporters that it's \"very offensive to women in terms of not understanding their agency, their authority, their right and their ability to make decisions about their own lives, including their own bodies.\"\n\"This is just the latest on a series of reveals by the former president of how he thinks about women and their agency,\" she added.\nThursday evening, Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt indicated in a statement that Trump also wanted to protect men and children from \"migrant crime and foreign adversaries.\"\u00a0\nTrump's comments come as a recent CBS News poll showed a widening gender gap among voters, with women supporting Vice President Kamala Harris by a 10-point margin. Among the findings, 40% of registered women voters say that the Trump campaign is paying too much attention to men's concerns, and 56% saying the campaign is paying too little attention to women's concerns.\u00a0\nIn recent weeks, Trump also referred to himself as \"father of IVF,\" and he's sustained criticism for disparaging remarks he's made about his opponent. Meanwhile, former ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, who competed against Trump during the primary, has pointed out how critical women are in this election, while urging the Trump campaign not to \"get overly masculine.\"\n\"Fifty-three percent of the electorate are women,\" Haley said on Fox News earlier this week. \"Women will vote. They care about how they're being talked to and they care about the issues. They need to remember that.\"\nMeanwhile, prominent women in politics believe women will overwhelmingly support Harris \u2014 and may do so in secret. Former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, who appeared on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, urged women to \"vote your conscience\" in the 2024 presidential election, even if it's not the way the men in their lives think they should vote.\n\"You should do what you think is right,\" Cheney said. \"And I think you're going to have, frankly, a lot of men and women who will go into the voting booth and will vote their conscience and will vote for Vice President Harris. They may not ever say anything publicly, but the results will speak for themselves.\"\nKaia Hubbard is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital, based in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u00a9 2024 CBS Interactive Inc.

Both will return to Wisconsin on Friday.\nOn stage at the Resch Center in Ashwaubenon, Trump said he disagreed with staff who had told him that saying he wanted to protect women was \"very inappropriate.\"\n\"I said, \u2018Well, I'm going to do it, whether the women like it or not. I'm going to protect them. I'm going to protect them from migrants coming in.

Wade.\nDemocrats since 2022 have won two of the last three major statewide races running largely on abortion \u2014 reelecting Tony Evers as governor and later flipping the state Supreme Court into liberal control for the first time in 15 years.\nSince Roe v. Wade was overturned, Trump has sent mixed messages over whether he supports the effects of the ruling \u2014 both taking credit for the ruling but also distancing himself from states' decisions to enact strict rules.\n\"This is just the latest on a series of reveals by the former president of how he thinks about women and their agency,\" Harris said.\nAlison Dirr can be reached at adirr@jrn.com."

Activate your online access\nThe former president wants to turn gender relations into a protection racket.\nDonald Trump thinks and acts like a gangster\u2014which is why his offers of protection always carry an undertone of threat. As my Nation colleague Sasha Abramsky and others have noted, Trump\u2019s foreign policy is premised on the idea that the United States would act as a global godfather, protecting allies in Europe and Asia in return for their tributes, but also perfectly willing to throw to the wolves those who don\u2019t pay. Trump\u2019s message to NATO has often been a variation of \u201cNice little European security system you have here! Would be a pity if anything happened to it.\u201d\nThe same rhetoric of protection governs Trump\u2019s domestic agenda. He casts himself as the strongman who can defend his supporters from various bogeymen, not just liberals and Democrats but also, more fancifully and hysterically, from socialists, Marxists, communists, Black Lives Matter, antifa, marauding immigrants, and even (taking his usual lies to the point of absurdity) cat-and-dog-eating Haitians.\nIn this presidential cycle, Trump\u2019s protection racket has taken on a sinister misogynist dimension. Trailing in polls with women because he ended the constitutional right to abortion by nominating three reactionary Supreme Court justices\u2014and because of his own infamous sexism\u2014Trump has developed a new line: that he\u2019s a protector of women.\nSpeaking at a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on Wednesday, Trump went even further than his normal spiel by acknowledging that the protection he was offering wasn\u2019t consensual. Trump started by admitting that his own campaign advisers told him that his description of himself as the protector of women was \u201cvery inappropriate.\u201d Trump says he responded, \u201cI want to protect the people. I want to protect the women of our country. I want to protect the women.\u201d Then Trump added, \u201cI said, \u2018Well, I\u2019m going to do it, whether the women like it or not, I\u2019m going to protect them.\u2019\u201d\nKamala Harris responded by saying Trump\u2019s rhetoric was \u201cvery offensive to women in terms of not understanding their agency, their authority, their rights and their ability to make decisions about their own lives including their own bodies.\u201d\nTrump is not just harking back to an older patriarchy but also zeroing in on the anxiety of his young male followers. Faced with what polls predict as a surge of women supporting Harris, the Trump campaign has decided that the gender gap can work in their favor if they can just rile up enough men\u2014particularly young men.\nOn Wednesday, prominent Trump supporter Charlie Kirk of Turning Point USA spelled out the anxiety at play in a tweet: \nEarly vote has been disproportionately female. If men stay at home, Kamala is president. It\u2019s that simple. If you want a vision of the future if you don\u2019t vote, imagine Kamala\u2019s voice cackling, forever. Men need to GO VOTE NOW.\nCommenting on Kirk\u2019s lament, Jess Bidgood of The New York Times noted:\nIt was a post that managed to both bemoan and explain a dynamic that has come to define the country\u2019s first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned the right to abortion. The gender gap between Harris and former President Donald Trump has grown large enough that just the fact of high turnout among women is enough to spook Republicans\u2014and yet they keep talking about women in ways that may further intensify that gap.\nSo Kirk may well be right that they need to scare up more men.\nBidgood observes, \u201cThe gender gap is especially pronounced among young voters. Among men between 18 and 29, Trump leads 58 percent to 37 percent, while Harris leads 67 percent to 28 percent among young women.\u201d\nThe problem for Trump is that not only is he more opposed by women than he is supported by men but women historically vote at a significantly higher rate than me. Traditionally, women vote by a rate roughly two percent higher than men: In 2020, 53 percent of women voted, and 51.3 percent of men. \nBut in 2024, early voting indicates the gender divide in voting has intensified, with women far more eager to vote. According to NBC News, of the nearly 62 million votes already cast, at least 54 percent are from women, 44 percent from men, with 12 percent not known. In the swing states, the numbers are sometimes starker. In Pennsylvania, 56 percent of early voters are women, as against 43 percent men. In Georgia, 56 percent are women, 44 percent men.\nIf women continue to vote at a rate 10 percent higher than men do, Trump\u2019s presidential bid is in big trouble. No wonder Charlie Kirk is worried. Nor is he alone. Right wing influencer Mike Cernovich tweeted, \u201cMale turnout in Pennsylvania for Trump has been a disaster. Unless this changes, Kamala Harris takes PA and it\u2019s over.\u201d\nRepublicans have been made equally anxious by some pro-Harris ads, one of which features actress Julia Roberts, encouraging married women to make up their own minds and not follow their husbands. Both former House speaker Newt Gingrich and Fox News host Jesse Watters\u2014two men not exactly famous for marital fidelity\u2014complained that the ad undermined the sanctity of wedded life. According to Gingrich, \u201cFor them to tell people to lie is just one further example of the depth of their corruption. How do you run a country, saying wives should lie to their husbands, husbands should lie to their wives?\u201d Watters fulminated, \u201cIf I found out [my wife] Emma was going into the voting booth and pulling the lever for Harris, that\u2019s the same thing as an affair.\u201d\nOne problem Republicans are running into is that there\u2019s scant evidence women want the kind of protection Donald Trump is offering. Nor do many women share the desire to subsume their political judgement to husbands like Gingrich and Watters.\nA further problem, perhaps seen in the low male turnout to date, is that many men aren\u2019t necessarily invested in Trump\u2019s vision of patriarchy either. To be sure, the majority support that Trump has among men does point to the continuing power of misogyny. But consider the actual policies Trump can be linked to.\nThere\u2019s good reason to believe that on matters relating to sexual freedom, much of what the Republican Party stands for is alien to many men. According to a Pew poll, 61 percent of men and 64 percent of women support legal abortion. Project 2025, an ambitious agenda that has shaped Republican goals for the next Trump administration, advocates banning pornography\u2014a position that a majority of Americans have long opposed.\nAs opposed to the Trump campaign\u2019s alienation of women, the pro-Harris PACs have cagily decided that men\u2014particularly young men\u2014can be won back on these issues of sexual liberty.\n\nJeet Heer \n\nJohn Nichols \n\nGregg Gonsalves \n\nChris Lehmann \nProgress Action Fund has released an incendiary ad on social media that opens with a young couple making love. The condom breaks and so the young man goes to bathroom to get Plan B, but he\u2019s stopped by a Republican congressman who says that contraceptives are now illegal and he should prepare to become a \u201cdaddy.\u201d A similar ad from the group warns of the dangers of pornography being outlawed. A parallel campaign warning of Trump\u2019s subservience to the social conservatism of Project 2025 and its goal of outlawing porn is targeting viewers of adult websites.\nThe election remains, by all evidence, very close. But one reason to be optimistic about Harris\u2019s chances is that her campaign and its allies have figured out a message of freedom that is energizing women, and even bringing a critical mass of men along.\nIf Trump loses, it\u2019ll be because women didn\u2019t want his protection racket\u2014and even some men saw it as a path to their own loss of freedom.\nJeet Heer is a national affairs correspondent for The Nation and host of the weekly Nation podcast, The Time of Monsters.

    "content": "\"Trump thinks he knows better than the women of America,\" Harris' campaign said.\nVice President Kamala Harris slammed former President Donald Trump on Thursday, saying his campaign rally pledge to protect women \"whether they like it or not\" was \"offensive to everybody.\"\n\"It's just -- it's actually is, I think, very offensive to women in terms of not understanding their agency, their authority, their right and their ability to make decisions about their own lives, including their own bodies,\" Harris told reporters in Wisconsin.\nHarris quickly rephrased her statement, saying, \"It is offensive to everybody.\"\nDuring the rally at Green Bay, Wisconsin, on Wednesday night, Trump attempted to appeal to women voters.\n\"I want to protect the women of our country,\" said Trump.\nHe said his remarks went against guidance from his advisers, whom he claimed had called the statement \"very inappropriate.\"\n\"I said why? I'm the president. I want to protect the women of our country,\" Trump said to loud applause.\nThe former president added, \"I said, 'Well, I'm going to do it whether the women like it or not. I'm going to protect them, I'm going to protect them from migrants coming in, I'm going to protect them from foreign countries that want to hit us with missiles -- and lots of other things.\"\nWith less than a week until Election Day, both candidates are working to sway undecided voters and make their final pitches in their bid for the White House.\nTrump made the comments about protecting women in Wisconsin, a battleground state where Harris narrowly leads, according to an analysis of the latest polls by ABC News' 538. Both candidates are working to appeal to women in a year that abortion is a key voter issue.\nPolling shows that Harris leads Trump by 9 points (56% to 42%) among women, according to a recent ABC News/Ipsos poll.\nHarris quickly pounced on Trump's remarks, saying in a statement she posted Wednesday night on social media, \"Donald Trump thinks he should get to make decisions about what you do with your body. Whether you like it or not.\"\nSarafina Chitika, Harris' campaign spokesperson, also took to social media, posting, \"Donald Trump thinks he knows better than the women of America. To him, our choices don't matter, our decisions are his to control, and he's going to ban abortion nationwide whether we like it or not.\"\nOn Thursday, Harris continued to blast Trump's comments.\n\"This is just the latest on a series of reveals by the former president of how he thinks about women and their agency, whether he has said -- as he has -- that women should be punished for their choices, whether he has talked about his pride in taking away a fundamental right from women, whether it be how he has actually created a situation in America where now 1 in 3 women lives in a Trump abortion ban state and has legal restrictions on the right she rightly should have to make decisions about her own body,\" Harris said.\nHarris added, \"Each day, I think there are also indications that we are receiving from my opponent that verify, validate and reinforce the fact that he's not going to be fighting for women's reproductive rights, he does not prioritize the freedom of women and the intelligence of women to make decisions about their own lives and bodies.\"\nTrump showed up to Wednesday's Wisconsin rally in a garbage truck bearing his name on the side and wearing a fluorescent-orange vest, like those worn by sanitation workers, to make a point about President Joe Biden's remarks at a campaign call this week during which he seemed to link Trump supporters and \"garbage.\"\nBiden and the White House tried to clarify his remarks, saying he was specifically referring to comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who called Puerto Rico a \"floating island of garbage\" at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday.\nTrump and other Republican leaders pounced on Biden's comment, claiming they believed that Biden was talking about all \"Trump supporters\" rather than a specific \"Trump supporter's\" relationship to garbage.\nEarlier this week, Nikki Haley, who served as U.N. ambassador in the Trump administration, said in an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier that she believes the former president is the best choice for the nation's economy, national security and for her own family.\n\"With Donald Trump we know what we're going to get. We lived the economy under Donald Trump. We know how strong he was on the border. We know how energy dominant we were, and then we also know what our national security looked like,\" Haley said in the interview, which aired Tuesday.\nHaley cautioned the Trump campaign to remain disciplined and focused on the issues.\n\"This is not a time to have anyone criticize Puerto Rico or Latinos,\" Haley said. \"This is not a time to get overly masculine with this bromance thing they've got going. Fifty-three percent of the electorate are women. Women will vote. They care about how they are being talked to and they care about the issues.\"\nTrump voiced his comments about protecting women the following day, which was also about six months after a New York jury found Trump liable for battery and defamation in a civil case brought against him by writer E. Jean Carroll, who claimed Trump sexually abused her in a Bergdorf Goodman department store dressing room in the 1990s.\nThe jury awarded Carroll a total of $5 million in the lawsuit. The panel found that Trump did not rape Carroll but sexually abused her, and awarded damages of $2 million in compensatory damages and $20,000 in punitive damages for battery. The jury also awarded $1 million in damages: $1.7 million for reputation repair and $280,000 in punitive damages, for defamation.\nTrump has denied the accusations leveled against him by Carroll.\nIn May, Trump was found guilty on all 34 felony counts related to a 2016 hush-money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels to keep her silent about an affair, marking the first time in history that a former U.S. president has been convicted on criminal charges. During the trial, Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen testified that he made the hush-money payments to Daniels on behalf of Trump to boost Trump's electoral prospects in the 2016 presidential election.\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump was caught on a hot mic boasting to former \"Access Hollywood\" host Billy Bush about how he grabbed women by the genitals.

    "content": "Already contributed? Log in to hide these messages.\nSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\nNAZARETH, Pa. \u2014 Pennsylvania Democrats believe comedian Tony Hinchcliffe\u2019s insulting remarks about Puerto Rico at Donald Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally on Oct. 27 are already helping turn out Puerto Rican voters who might have otherwise stayed home in this critical swing state.\nOut of the seven battleground states that will decide the winner of Tuesday\u2019s election between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, Pennsylvania has the largest population of Puerto Ricans. The Keystone State\u2019s nearly 500,000-person Puerto Rican population is concentrated in North Philadelphia, the Lehigh Valley, Reading and Hazleton. \nThe same day Hinchcliffe\u2019s remarks shook the political firmament, Harris had been campaigning in the Puerto Rican community in North Philadelphia.\n\u201cI have heard from the Puerto Rican community directly about how much they were offended\u201d by Hinchcliffe\u2019s remarks, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) said Saturday while campaigning for Anna Thomas, a Democratic running for Pennsylvania state representative. \u201cI think it woke up the community in a way that is going to turn them out in even greater numbers for Kamala Harris.\u201d\nPressed to explain why these remarks might resonate with voters who are not already firmly in one corner, when so many other Trump or Trump-related comments have failed to damage him, Shapiro said, \u201cThis is my sense from being all over the state: that it broke through, and it resonated in a way with the community, where it made them say, \u2018Well, wait a minute, that guy\u2019s not for us. That guy doesn\u2019t respect us.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cThey keep saying, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s only a comedian.\u2019 It still hurts.\u201d\nState Rep. Josh Siegel (D), who represents Allentown, a city that\u2019s a Puerto Rican hub, and Lamont McClure, executive of Northampton County, had similar assessments at the campaign event on Saturday. \n\u201cIt\u2019s had an undeniable impact on the ground here in the Lehigh Valley,\u201d Siegel said.\nReached by phone on Saturday, Philadelphia City Council member Quetcy Lozada (D), who is Puerto Rican, said her office had received messages from people who voted for Trump and wanted to know if they could change their votes. (They cannot.)\nLozada, who accompanied Harris to a Puerto Rican restaurant while she was campaigning in North Philadelphia, has also heard from many constituents who say their friends and relatives were either leaning toward Trump or were not planning on voting until they heard about Hinchcliffe\u2019s insult. It\u2019s a marked change from the mixed results Lozada had gotten some days while door-knocking for Harris in parts of North Philadelphia before Hinchcliffe\u2019s remarks.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen a huge level of anger and feeling of disrespect,\u201d Lozada said. \u201cI think we will see folks who were undecided up until just this week turn out for Harris. We are going to see Puerto Ricans come out in record numbers to demand to be respected. And they\u2019re going to demand that through their vote.\u201d\nStrategists from both major parties are still reeling from a critical moment in Trump\u2019s xenophobia-filled rally on Oct. 27 that Democrats hope could provide a marginal advantage in the final days. While delivering a comedy set filled with racist jokes, Hinchcliffe, a comedian based in Austin, Texas, described Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean.\u201d\nIn a rally full of nativist and racist remarks, Hinchcliffe\u2019s comments nonetheless stood out for the politically important constituency they offended. Republican-elected officials from Florida and other Puerto Rican-heavy states and districts rushed to condemn the remarks. Puerto Rican pop stars Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez and Ricky Martin responded that night by sharing a Harris video appeal to Puerto Rican voters.\nThe Trump campaign took the rare step of distancing him from the insulting comedy set, saying that the \u201cjoke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.\u201d\nBut Trump\u2019s Puerto Rican critics have faulted him for failing to apologize or to condemn Hinchcliffe\u2019s remarks right away while taking the podium.\n\u201cI specifically asked the audience, \u2018OK, what about if Trump today, all of a sudden, decides to apologize \u2026 Would that be OK? Would you take that in consideration?\u2019\u201d Victor Martinez, host of a Spanish-language morning radio show popular throughout Pennsylvania, said on CNN on Tuesday. \u201cOverwhelmingly, everybody was like, \u2018Nope, too late.\u2019\u201d\nSeeking to capitalize on the blowback Trump has gotten, the Harris campaign dispatched the vice president\u2019s sister, Maya Harris, and Puerto Rican musical theater artist Lin-Manuel Miranda to rally Puerto Rican voters at the Puerto Rican Beneficial Society in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, on Thursday. Harris is due to hold a rally in neighboring Allentown on Monday afternoon.\nHuffPost spoke with several Puerto Rican voters outside of a CTown Supermarket on Bethlehem\u2019s south side, across the street from the Puerto Rican Beneficial Society.\nNilsa Vega and Neidel Pacheco of Hellertown, a borough south of Bethlehem, both said they had never voted before, but Hinchcliffe\u2019s remarks were the reason they planned to vote for Harris on Tuesday.\n\u201cThat hit the spot right there,\u201d Vega said. \u201cThey keep saying, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s only a comedian.\u2019 It still hurts.\u201d\nPacheco saw Trump\u2019s decision to pose in a garbage truck at a campaign stop in Wisconsin the following day as an additional insult. \u201cIf he didn\u2019t have nothing to do with it, what\u2019s he doing in the garbage truck?\u201d Pacheco asked.\nSergio Martinez, a warehouse worker from Bethlehem, said he had never voted before and is torn about whether to vote now. He thinks Trump \u201ckept the country strong \u2014 as far as economy-wise \u2014 and kept the borders a little tighter.\u201d\nFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.\nAt such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.\nThe Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.\nDonald Trump got off his private plane in Green Bay, Wisconsin on Wednesday evening and, donning a bright orange safety vest, got into a garbage truck in an attempt to troll Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.\nWith election day looming, both the Republican and Democratic candidates are hoping to leverage the racist comments made against Puerto Rico at Trump\u2019s rally in Madison Square Garden on Sunday when a comedian called the US territory \u201ca floating island of garbage.\u201d\nThe truck was emblazoned with the Trump campaign logo and with the former president leaning out of the window similarly to his McDonald\u2019s photo-op, he asked the press: \u201cHow do you like my garbage truck?\u201d\nHe added that it was \u201cin honor of Kamala and Joe Biden\u201d and proceeded to say the president \u201cshould be ashamed of himself\u201d and that \u201cshe should never have let it happen\u201d referring to Biden\u2019s verbal flub on Tuesday night.\nThe president stumbled over his words while on a call causing a brouhaha over what was actually said, with the Trump campaign claiming he had called their supporters garbage and the White House saying that Biden had said he was referring to the comedian\u2019s demonization of Latinos.\nTrump\u2019s garbage truck stunt might have gone better had he not spoken to reporters about the comedian, the comment, and Puerto Rico, while leaning from the vehicle\u2019s window, prolonging the scandal over the remarks.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about the comedian,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cI don\u2019t know who he is. I\u2019ve never seen him. I heard he made a statement, but it was a statement that he made. He\u2019s a comedian, what can I tell you. I know nothing about him.\u201d\nJake Rosen of CBS News asked the former president if he owed Puerto Rico an apology, to which he replied: \u201cI love Puerto Rico and Puerto Rico loves me.\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cNobody\u2019s done more for Puerto Rico than me. I took care of them when they had the two hurricanes. And nobody gets along better with Puerto Rico and the Puerto Rican people than me. They love me and I love them.\u201d\nSunday\u2019s remarks caused outrage throughout the Puerto Rican community, with prominent members endorsing Harris and condemning Trump. Reggaeton star Nicky Jam who had endorsed the former president has rescinded his support, saying: \u201cPuerto Rico deserves respect.\u201d\nWhat was not lost on commentators was that Trump has recently also taken to describing the whole of the US as the \u201cgarbage can of the world\u201d when talking about immigration.\nFormer Trump aide Alyssa Farah Griffin ran through how she felt the Republican candidate\u2019s outing went in a post on X: \u201cIs it an effective stunt? No. He\u2019s assuming voters hear \u201cgarbage\u201d & think of Biden\u2019s gaffe.. but Trump campaign\u2019s Puerto Rico debacle is much deeper in the zeitgeist. A total fail.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cTrump platforms offensive joke leading to days of outrage; Trump tries to clean it up on Fox; Biden steps in it, unintentionally gives Trump a lifeline; Trump\u2019s genius campaign: \u2018Let\u2019s remind everyone we offended Puerto Ricans & called America garbage by driving a garbage truck!\u2019\u201d\nTommy Vietor, a former staffer for Barack Obama, called out Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita directly saying it was a \u201cgenius plan\u201d to keep \u201cthe Puerto Rican joke controversy in the news for another day\u201d.\nRon Filipkowski, editor-in-chief of MeidasTouch.com, was similarly impressed, recalling when the former president infamously threw paper towels to hurricane survivors in the US territory: \u201cThe plan for the day for the Trump campaign was to have Trump talk about the Puerto Rico controversy from a garbage truck? Because that\u2019s what happened. Nice optics. All we are missing is the paper towels.\u201d\nHarris spokesperson Sarafina Chitika posted: \u201cThe candidate who called America a \u2018trash can\u2019; Whose rally called Puerto Rico \u2018garbage\u2019; Is riding around in a garbage truck for fun. Is this an in-kind donation to @KamalaHQ?\u201d\nThe stunt also raised questions about Trump\u2019s health given he still hasn\u2019t released any medical report with less than a week to go before the election.\nVideo footage of the former president approaching the truck shows him failing to grip the door handle twice and stumbling slightly before pulling himself up toward the vehicle.\nIn an odd move the same clip was used by Sean Hannity on his Fox News show, when he called the moment \u201cepic,\u201d and by the network\u2019s social media accounts.\nOver on MSNBC, host Alex Wagner described the whole episode as her five-year-old\u2019s dream: \u201cWhat happens when you get old and you\u2019re a guy? You get to do that all day \u2014 drive the garbage truck around.\u201d\nPerhaps that is Trump\u2019s dream. Early in his presidency, he was photographed having a great time sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a semi-truck outside the White House at an event for truckers and CEOs.\nSeveral months later he was again pictured in a truck at the White House, this time a fire truck manufactured by Wisconsin-based Pierce, for a Made in America event.\nThe latest stunt wasn\u2019t over when Trump got out of the truck. He wore the neon orange safety vest throughout his rally in Green Bay.\nMenswear expert Derek Guy tweeted: \u201cI recommend not wearing vests in the same color as your face.\u201d\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nPlease refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged inPlease refresh your browser to be logged in"

    "content": "ByAlison Durkee\n\nByAlison Durkee,\n Forbes Staff. \nFormer President Donald Trump and his supporters\u2014including billionaire Elon Musk\u2014have spread claims about election irregularities and fraud in Pennsylvania despite officials saying their claims have no merit, as the ex-president begins sowing distrust in the election results as polls suggest he\u2019s virtually tied with Vice President Kamala Harris.\nFormer President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally on Oct. 29 in Allentown, Pa. \nTrump has repeatedly suggested on social media there\u2019s election fraud in Pennsylvania without showing evidence, writing on Truth Social Thursday, \u201cWe caught them CHEATING BIG in Pennsylvania.\u201d\nPennsylvania is one of the most high-stakes battleground states in the presidential election\u2014awarding 19 electors to whomever wins\u2014and polling there shows Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris neck-and-neck.\nTrump\u2019s comments echo his false claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election, which he used to unsuccessfully try and overturn the vote count after President Joe Biden won, and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro claimed on X that Trump is now \u201ctrying to use the same playbook to stoke chaos\u201d in this election.\nTrump and his supporters\u2019 claims are being amplified in this election by billionaire Elon Musk, who has shared false fraud claims on X, formerly known as Twitter, and allowed conspiracy theories to spread freely on the social platform, which he owns.\nState election officials have debunked and opposed the false claims of fraud, with Pennsylvania Secretary of State Al Schmidt saying at a media briefing Wednesday, \u201cSpreading videos and other information that lack context, sharing social posts filled with half-truths or even outright lies is harmful to our representative democracy.\u201d\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania said Sunday at least nine counties in the state have received \u201cmass-produced challenges to the eligibility of overseas voters.\u201d Republicans have taken issue with the eligibility of some overseas voters to vote in swing states with fewer verification requirements or when they haven\u2019t resided in the state, such as spouses or children of Pennsylvanians who have moved abroad. Those voters still remain eligible to vote under federal law, however, and a federal judge in Pennsylvania dismissed a challenge to overseas voters in October, noting the guidance around overseas voting has been in place for years and the GOP lawmakers who sued to change it \u201cprovide no good excuse for waiting until barely a month before the election to bring this lawsuit.\u201d\nTrump and other Republicans have made claims of voter fraud based on instances in multiple counties in which election officials received unusually large groups of voter registration applications, which were reviewed and sent to district attorney\u2019s offices to investigate potential fraud. Lancaster County reported \u201chundreds\u201d of fraudulent applications were sent to investigators and York County reported approximately a quarter of the 3,000 registration applications it received in bulk were declined and are undergoing further review. Officials also reported irregular applications in Monroe County, though election officials in Luzerne County, where some last-minute application forms were also flagged, said after reviewing the applications that none were fraudulent. While Trump and other Republicans have held up these instances as evidence of voter fraud, election officials told The Washington Post they were more likely the \u201csloppy work of a paid canvasser trying to meet a quota\u201d rather than a malicious instance of fraud. Since the irregularities were only reported in voter registration applications, there is also no impact on any actual ballots or votes.\nThe Trump campaign and its allies, including running mate Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, have pushed claims that voters were denied the opportunity to vote in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, despite being in line before voting ended for the day, with Vance amplifying claims that Democrat-allied \u201cvoter protection\u201d workers were cutting off the line. The Trump campaign ultimately filed a lawsuit that resulted in early voting being extended in the county until Friday. Bucks County has pushed back against the suggestions that voters were intentionally being stopped from voting and cut off in line, saying on Monday, \u201cContrary to what is being depicted on social media, if you are in line by 5 p.m. for an on-demand mail-in ballot application, you will have the opportunity to submit your application for a mail-in ballot.\u201d (The state does not have traditional early voting, but allows voters to request and submit mail ballots in person.) The county did acknowledge there was a \u201cmiscommunication\u201d that meant \u201cindividuals in line to apply for an on-demand mail-in ballot were briefly told they could not be accommodated,\u201d but added that those voters \u201cwere given the opportunity to submit mail-in ballot applications today.\u201d\nThe Trump campaign claimed in a campaign email Monday that a woman in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, was arrested \u201cfor fighting voter suppression\u201d and \u201cencouraging people to stay in line and vote.\u201d Delaware County responded in a statement, reported by ABC News, saying the woman in question was being \"disruptive, belligerent, and attempting to influence voters waiting in line,\u201d and remained in the polling place\u2019s lobby for two hours and \u201capproached various individuals\u201d but did not get in line to vote herself. Police apprehended the woman and asked her to leave after voters complained, county officials said, and first \u201cprovided her with verbal guidance on appropriate behavior and allowed her to remain in the lobby.\u201d After additional complaints were lodged against the woman and she refused to leave, she was \u201cbriefly detained, and was issued a citation for disorderly conduct,\u201d a county spokesperson told ABC News. \nA viral video posted on X Monday purporting to show a man dropping off an \u201cobscene amount of ballots\u201d in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, actually depicted a postal worker delivering ballots to the local elections office, NBC News confirmed. The video, which was shared by right-wing influencers including Alex Jones, has led to the postal worker getting harassed, Northampton County Executive Lamont McClure told NBC, adding, \u201cI hope if you do a story that the story will be that this is incredibly stupid election misinformation \u2026 And, you know, stop it.\u201d\nAfter a video went viral that was purporting to show ballots being ripped up in Bucks County, the FBI, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a joint statement saying they had determined \u201cRussian actors manufactured and amplified\u201d the video, describing it as \u201cpart of Moscow\u2019s broader effort to raise unfounded questions about the integrity of the US election and stoke divisions among Americans.\u201d The video has been attributed to Russian disinformation team Storm-1516, NBC reports. Local prosecutors also separately debunked the video, similarly \u201cconclud[ing] that this video was fabricated in an attempt to undermine confidence in the upcoming election.\u201d\nTrump supporters complained about noncitizens allegedly being allowed to vote in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, after social media posts claimed buses of non-English speakers arrived at a polling place and those voters cut other people in line. Allegheny County issued a statement saying a video posted on social media only showed a \u201cbrief conversation between voters, their translators, and a County employee,\u201d after which elderly and disabled voters in the group were allowed to sit down as they waited to vote while able-bodied members of the group went to the back of the line. Sam DeMarco, a local council member who supports Trump, shared the county\u2019s statement, and local outlet TribLive reports that he was told by county lawyers the voters at issue are U.S. citizens who are members of the local Nepalese and Bhutanese community. \u201cThese are members of the refugee community, and they are registered to vote in Allegheny County,\u201d DeMarco said, and Bhutanese Community Association of Pittsburgh director Khara Timsina told TribLive the voters became citizens around 2013 and 2014. While Republicans have made false claims about noncitizens voting in the November election, in practice noncitizen voting is extremely rare, with one study finding only 0.0001% of ballots cast in 2016 across 12 states were unlawful votes by noncitizens.\nTrump and his supporters are likely to continue spreading false claims of fraud through and after Election Day. Those claims are likely to spread more rapidly and unchecked on X, CNN notes, where Musk has allowed misinformation and disinformation to spread without the moderation measures that other social platforms have taken\u2014and repeatedly spread the false claims himself. \u201cElon Musk is a huge problem,\u201d an unnamed Pennsylvania official told CNN. (Musk has not yet responded to a request for comment.) Pennsylvania is one of the states that\u2019s likely to take longer to report election results, due to laws in the state that only allow election workers to start processing ballots on Election Day. That could allow misinformation to further spread while ballots are being counted, as happened in 2020. Trump also filed numerous lawsuits in the state in 2020 taking issue with election processes and falsely alleging fraud\u2014nearly all of which failed, save for one minor lawsuit affecting only a small number of votes\u2014which may happen again this year. Schmidt said Thursday that while the final timing of the election results will depend on how close the race is\u2014and final results will not be available by Election Day\u2014the state has taken steps since 2020 to try and speed up the ballot counting process, like giving counties the funds to invest in more resources for counting. Counties will also now be required to report how many ballots are still left to count, which will help combat claims of ballots being \u201cfound\u201d at the last minute that proliferated during the 2020 election.\nWhile Trump has pointed to issues like the allegedly fraudulent voter registrations as being evidence of the election being fraudulent and rigged against him, election officials told the Post that the fact the registrations were flagged actually shows the guardrails that are in place to catch and prevent election fraud are working as they should. Nina Jancowitz, CEO of anti-disinformation group American Sunlight Project, also noted to CNN that the outsized role Musk is playing in the election and him using X to freely spread false information \u201cis far closer to election interference than any of the allegations that conservatives have made against social media platforms from 2016 to 2022.\u201d\nPennsylvania 2024 Trump-Harris Polls: Race Virtually Tied In 7 New Surveys Of Vital Battleground (Forbes)\nTrump alleges fraud in Pennsylvania, but officials say the election is secure (Washington Post)\n Election officials are outmatched by Elon Musk\u2019s misinformation machine  (CNN)\n\u2018Big lie\u2019 2.0: How Trump\u2019s false claims about noncitizens voting lay the groundwork to undermine the election (NBC News)\nPennsylvania officials reject viral claim about illegal voters (BBC)"

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Kamala Harris said Friday it was \u201cdisqualifying\u201d for Donald Trump to say former Rep. Liz Cheney, one of the former president\u2019s most prominent Republican critics, should have rifles \u201cshooting at her\u201d to see how she feels about sending troops to fight.\nThe Democratic vice president has campaigned extensively with Cheney, especially in the \u201cblue wall\u201d battleground states that make up her strongest path to victory on Tuesday, while Trump has been going after the former Wyoming congresswoman and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, over the Iraq war and U.S. military interventions abroad.\nSpeaking to reporters after arriving in Madison, Wisconsin, Harris asked voters to consider who they\u2019d prefer sitting in the Oval Office, driving the message she\u2019s been emphasizing in the campaign\u2019s closing week. Harris called Cheney \u201ca true patriot\u201d and said Trump \u201chas increased his violent rhetoric.\u201d \n\u201cHis enemies list has grown longer. His rhetoric has grown more extreme,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAnd he is even less focused than before on the needs and the concerns and the challenges facing the American people.\u201d\nTrump and his allies say his comments are being misconstrued. They say he was arguing that Cheney is a \u201cwar hawk\u201d but would be less supportive of using the military if she had to fight in wars herself. \nHe doubled down Friday, repeating the same imagery that drove the backlash. \n\n\n\u201cIf you gave Liz Cheney a gun and put her into battle, facing the other side with the guns pointing at her, she wouldn\u2019t have the courage and the strength or the stamina to even look the enemy in the eye,\u201d Trump said during a rally in Warren, Michigan. \nThe Republican presidential candidate has been using increasingly threatening rhetoric against his adversaries and talked of \u201cenemies from within\u201d undermining the country. Some of his former senior aides and Harris have labeled him a fascist in response.\nCheney, who broke with Trump after a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, on Friday called the former president a \u201ccruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant.\u201d\nTrump has ramped up his critiques of the Cheneys in swing state Michigan, where he is competing with Harris for the votes of Arab Americans opposed to U.S. backing of Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack and its subsequent invasion of Lebanon. \nAt an event late Thursday in Arizona with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Trump was asked whether it was strange to see Cheney campaign against him. The former congresswoman has vocally opposed Trump since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and endorsed Harris, joining the vice president at recent stops as they try to win over Republicans disaffected with Trump.\nTrump called Cheney \u201ca deranged person\u201d and added: \u201cBut the reason she couldn\u2019t stand me is that she always wanted to go to war with people. If it were up to her we\u2019d be in 50 different countries.\u201d\nThe former president continued: \u201cShe\u2019s a radical war hawk. Let\u2019s put her with the rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her. OK, let\u2019s see how she feels about it. You know, when the guns are trained on her face.\n\u201cYou know they\u2019re all war hawks when they\u2019re sitting in Washington in a nice building saying, oh gee, well, let\u2019s send 10,000 troops right into the mouth of the enemy,\u201d Trump said.\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, is \u201clooking into\u201d whether Trump\u2019s comments broke state law, her spokesperson, Richie Taylor, confirmed. Mayes told KPNX-TV on Friday that she\u2019d asked her criminal division chief to analyze whether the comments qualify as a death threat.\nCheney responded Friday in a post on X: \u201cThis is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death. We cannot entrust our country and our freedom to a petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant.\u201d\nOne prominent Trump critic, former Republican congressman Joe Walsh, argued the former president\u2019s comment had been taken out of context and that Trump was \u201cNOT calling for Liz Cheney to be executed in front of a firing line.\u201d\n\u201cIn Trump\u2019s typically stupid, ugly fashion, he\u2019s trying to make a point about Cheney\u2019s stance on war,\u201d Walsh said on X. \nIan Sams, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, suggested that Trump was \u201ctalking about sending a prominent Republican to the firing squad, and you have Vice President Harris talking about sending one to her Cabinet. This is the difference in this race.\u201d\nTrump said he was making a point about Cheney\u2019s foreign policy record.\n\u201cShe wanted to ... go to war with everybody because she, like Kamala, is a stupid person,\u201d Trump said of Cheney in Michigan. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for her to say she wants to start wars from the comfort of her nice home.\u201d \nEarlier, during a stop at a restaurant in nearby Dearborn, he called Cheney a \u201ccoward\u201d and said \u201cshe\u2019d be the first one to chicken out\u201d if put on a battlefield. Women were not allowed to serve in direct combat roles until 2013, when Cheney was 47.\nHis spokesperson, Karoline Leavitt, said his comments were being taken out of context, calling the controversy \u201cthe latest fake media outrage.\u201d \nThroughout his campaign, Trump has been fixated on the Americans he believes have wronged or betrayed him. He has portrayed them as worse than the United States\u2019 foreign adversaries, referring to them as \u201cenemies from within.\u201d\nHe\u2019s threatened to use the federal government, including the military, to go after them. And he has repeatedly threatened \u201clong term prison sentences\u201d for those \u201cinvolved in unscrupulous behavior\u201d this election, including political operatives, donors and elected officials. \nHe said people he labeled as \u201cthe enemy from within\u201d should be \u201cvery easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military.\u201d\nSome of Trump\u2019s supporters have said his talk of vengeance is either justified or hyperbole.\n___\nGomez Licon reported from Dearborn, Michigan and Glendale, Arizona.

    "publish_date": "2024-11-01",
    "content": "Europe\u2019s Green Party is telling third-party candidate Jill Stein to step aside for the sake of America and the world. \nEuropean Green Party representatives from Italy, Ireland, Spain, and 13 other countries across the continent came together to sign onto a letter asking the U.S. Green Party\u2019s Stein to withdraw her candidacy and endorse Democrat Kamala Harris for the sake of democracy.\n\u201cRight now, the race for the White House is too close for comfort,\u201d wrote the French and Austrian co-chairs of the coalition in a statement released Friday. \u201cWe are clear that Kamala Harris is the only candidate who can block Donald Trump and his anti-democratic, authoritarian policies from the White House.\u201d\nThere is no longer any formal relationship between the U.S. Green Party and the European Greens across the pond, in part because of key differences in policy around Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, so the statement is just a plea rather than a binding resolution. In their letter, the Europeans highlighted the connection between Trump\u2019s \u201cauthoritarianism\u201d and his close relationships with right-wing leaders Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Vladimir Putin, and Jair Bolsonaro, arguing that electing Trump would embolden anti-democratic actions around the globe. \nFurther, they also argued that by taking away votes from Harris and allowing a Trump win, Stein will not be able to help \u201cbring about a just and sustainable peace in the Middle East,\u201d an issue in which the U.S. Green Party candidate has staked her 2024 campaign upon. \nIn previous statements to The Guardian, U.S. Green Party spokespeople said they\u2019ve been disappointed by the European Greens\u2019 \u201csilence and complicity\u201d over Israel and Gaza, stating that the parties have \u201crelied too much on US corporate news media\u201d regarding the ongoing genocide. \nStein is polling at less than 2 percent nationally but may take home a larger share of the vote in battleground states like Michigan and Pennsylvania, where Arab and Muslim voters alongside others on the left have rallied around the call to cast a \u201cconscience vote\u201d against the U.S.-backed Israeli onslaught on Gaza. \nOthers, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, see Stein\u2019s candidacy as a potential spoiler for the election. \u201cAll you do is show up once every four years to speak to people who are justifiably pissed off, but you\u2019re just showing up once every four years to do that, you\u2019re not serious,\u201d said the congresswoman. \n\nAt a rally Thursday night in Nevada, Donald Trump pledged to put Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in charge of \u201cwomen\u2019s health\u201d if he\u2019s elected president. \n\u201cHe\u2019s going to work on health, and women\u2019s health, and all of the different reasons \u2018cause we\u2019re not really a wealthy or healthy country,\u201d Trump told a crowd of supporters. \nKamala Harris had a one-word response.\nNo. \u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/mHXJZ0Jba5\nKennedy, formerly an independent candidate for president, dropped out of the race in August and endorsed Trump, likely in exchange for a prominent role in a potential second Trump term. Some reports suggest that Kennedy could get a Cabinet position, such as secretary of Health and Human Services, or have a hand in choosing appointees. In fact, Kennedy has already recommended a prominent vaccine skeptic for HHS.\nKennedy heading up women\u2019s health would be a disaster. Kennedy has a long history of opposing vaccines, and his anti-vax conspiracies even helped spread a measles outbreak in Samoa that killed 83 people, most of them children. Kennedy also supports restrictions on abortion, and blames the rise in mass shootings on antidepressants and video games. \nKennedy has co-opted Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan into his own initiative, \u201cMake America Healthy Again.\u201d But his own health hasn\u2019t been as impeccable as he claims, admitting that a doctor once suspected a worm ate part of his brain and then died inside his head. \nHis record with women\u2019s issues apart from health isn\u2019t good, either: He has a reputation as a compulsive womanizer, which may have been a contributing factor in the 2012 suicide of his second wife, Mary Richardson. If more recent allegations are to be believed, Kennedy also carried on an affair with journalist Olivia Nuzzi, leading to her losing her job with New York magazine. \nKennedy\u2019s reputation should be toxic enough for the Trump administration in any role, let alone one connected to public health and women. The question is whether this would help Trump attract any voters on the fence, or remind them that the former president\u2019s reputation on public health isn\u2019t so great either. \n\nDonald Trump is once again exaggerating conspiracy theories about Democrats committing voter fraud into existence.\u00a0\nDuring a rally in Glendale, Arizona, Thursday night, Trump claimed that there had been \u201cbad votes\u201d discovered in York County and Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, a key battleground state where early voting has indicated that Trump isn\u2019t doing too well.\u00a0\nTrump claimed that in Lancaster County, \u201cthere were 2,600 votes that happened to be written by the same pen, same hand, same signature, same everything. Uhhhh maybe there\u2019s an explanation for that? Two thousand six hundred votes!\u201d\nThere is an explanation for that, actually, which is that it\u2019s a lie. Lancaster County didn\u2019t discover thousands of fraudulent votes, but flagged a batch of voter registration forms for review.\u00a0\nLast week, the county flagged around 2,500 voter registration forms for issues, including fake names, dubious signatures, inaccurate addresses and social security information, and other worrying details including suspicious handwriting, according to the Associated Press. Not only were the forms not ballots, but there was no evidence to suggest that they were all written by the same person.\nOf the voter registration forms investigated, around three out of five had problems, according to Lancaster County District Attorney Heather Adams, who said Thursday her office was still actively investigating the issue.\u00a0\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Trump has attempted to place Lancaster\u2019s investigation at the center of his bogus claims of voter fraud. The former president posted on Truth Social Monday that Lancaster County had been \u201ccaught with 2600 Fake Ballots and Forms, all written by the same person.\u201d\u00a0\nBy Wednesday, he was full-on raging over his fake version of the story. \u201cPennsylvania is cheating, and getting caught, at large scale levels rarely seen before,\u201d he wrote. \u201cREPORT CHEATING TO AUTHORITIES. Law Enforcement must act, NOW!\u201d\nYork County has also received suspicious voter registration forms and mail-in ballot applications, according to ABC News. The county had received the forms as part of a large delivery of election materials from a third-party organization Field+Media Corps, which was acting on behalf of the Everybody Votes Campaign, according to County Commissioner Julie Wheeler. The documents are now under review, and if officials discover fraud, the forms will be fully investigated by the district attorney, Wheeler said. \u00a0\nBoth Lancaster County and York County supported Trump in the 2020 election.\u00a0\nAs Election Day approaches, and likely for many weeks after, Trump is sure to continue exaggerating to the point of invention as he attempts to undermine the integrity of the election.\n\nElon Musk is now under fire in multiple swing states over his election interference. \nRepublican Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has asked Elon Musk to take down an \u201cobviously fake\u201d video which appeared to show a Haitian immigrant who claimed to have voted multiple times in Georgia and encouraged others to do the same. \n\u201cThis is false and is an example of targeted disinformation we\u2019ve seen in this and other elections. It is likely foreign interference attempting to sow discord and chaos on the eve of the 2024 Presidential election,\u201d Raffensperger wrote in a statement on Thursday night.\nHis office says that they are working to identify exactly where the video came from, and that the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, is also investigating the matter. But Raffensperger and CISA have their suspicions about its origin.\n\u201cThis is obviously fake and part of a disinformation effort. Likely it is a production of Russian troll farms,\u201d wrote Raffensperger. \u201cThe likeliest suspect is a Russian troll farm,\u201d Gabriel Sterling, chief operating officer for the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office, agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s isn\u2019t even that good of a fake \u2026 but it is fake. It is a lie. Please let anyone you know that this is a steaming pile of Russian \u2026 well you get it.\u201d\nFormer CISA Director Chris Krebs also called the video \u201cmore nonsense from Russian troll farms.\u201d\nGeorgia was subjected to massive disinformation campaigns during Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn the 2020 election and was subject to Russian interference campaigns that sowed conflict in the state in 2016. \nBut fomenting distrust in the election system is easier when it\u2019s coming from Trump and Musk themselves. In recent days, both billionaires have peddled lies about mass voter fraud in Pennsylvania.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s campaign may have been riding high in a garbage truck earlier this week, but the latest numbers out of Pennsylvania have them feeling pretty trashed.\nIn Pennsylvania, more than 100,000 new voters have already cast their ballots ahead of Election Day on November 5, dwarfing the 80,000 vote margin by which Joe Biden beat Trump in 2020, according to NBC News. \nThat means that if everyone who voted in 2020 cast their ballots the same way this year, this group of new voters would decide the race. Unfortunately for Trump, this group is dominated by female registered Democrats, who are likely to split for Kamala Harris.\nNearly 62 million early votes had already been cast nationwide as of Thursday evening, with 54 percent of ballots having been cast by women and 44 percent cast by men, according to Newsweek. Early voting in Pennsylvania mirrors that trend.*\nWhile this data comes days ahead of Election Day, and women are more likely than men to vote early, the number of female voters has regularly exceeded the number of male voters in every presidential election since 1980. And this trend in early voting isn\u2019t just contained to Pennsylvania. Across several battleground states, there is a 10-point gender gap in early voting so far, according to Politico. \nIn an essential battleground state such as Pennsylvania, where polls have shown a particularly tight race, turnout and enthusiasm could be the key for Harris to claim victory in a state Trump plainly needs to win. And apparently, Trump\u2019s team is panicking, according to Puck News.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going so crazy here,\u201d one campaign source told Puck\u2019s Tara Palmeri. \u201cAnyone who hears how rabid they are about this issue can\u2019t walk away from this and think they feel comfortable about where they\u2019re at in PA.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re talking about criminal referrals,\u201d the source continued. \u201cThey want to find poll watchers who they feel are engaged in voter suppression so that they can refer criminal prosecutions.\u201d\nThe Trump campaign has already set to work making their desperate attempts to smear campaign officials in Pennsylvania. Earlier this week, the Trump campaign and Republican National Committee Co-Chair Michael Whatley accused election officials in Delaware County of \u201cactively suppressing\u201d voters after one woman, a Trump supporter, was arrested at a polling station, according to ABC News. \nDelaware County officials said that the woman had been \u201cdisruptive, belligerent, and attempting to influence voters waiting in line.\u201d Later, officials said that the woman \u201cdid not get in line for any service,\u201d loitered in the lobby for nearly two hours, and \u201capproached various individuals,\u201d which prompted complaints. \nIn a video with Whatley, the woman claimed she had been arrested \u201cfor exercising my First Amendment right\u201d as she \u201ctried to get the vote out.\u201d\nThe Trump campaign has continued to push narratives of alleged voter suppression by election officials. In Bucks County, Pennsylvania, Trump and Senate candidate David McCormick sued the county over long lines at polling stations as people tried to register for mail-in voting. A judge has since extended the deadline to sign up for mail-in voting in the county. Both Delaware County and Bucks County supported Biden over Trump in 2020.\n* This article previously misstated the number of early votes cast in Pennsylvania.\n\nDonald Trump made a dark and ominous threat against former Representative Liz Cheney, one of his most prominent critics. \nAt a campaign event in Glendale, Arizona, with Tucker Carlson Thursday night, Trump attacked Cheney\u2019s record on war, calling her \u201ca very dumb individual.\u201d The former president also insulted her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, and insinuated that she should be shot. \n\u201cShe\u2019s a radical war hawk. Let\u2019s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, okay? Let\u2019s see how she feels about it. You know, when the guns are trained on her face,\u201d Trump said. \nTrump on Liz Cheney: \"Let's put her with a rifle standing there with 9 barrels shooting at her. Let's see how she feels about it. You know, when the guns are trained on her face.\" pic.twitter.com/Mtx1fbLtwE\nTrump\u2019s threat evoked his earlier comments about using the military against \u201cthe enemy within,\u201d which he said included the likes of Representatives Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi. Apparently, Cheney would also be on that list. \nTrump\u2019s gruesome attack was immediately met with backlash, including from Cheney herself. \nWith the election only days away, Trump has ramped up his violent rhetoric in a desperate attempt to scare up whatever votes he can, going after one of his most well-known critics in Cheney, who is campaigning with Kamala Harris. If he was trying to paint Cheney as a warmonger in comparison to himself, he failed heavily, as his choice of words is now what people are talking about. \n\nExplosive new audio reveals that Donald Trump detailed how he really felt about his White House staff to Jeffrey Epstein, and Epstein touted old photos of Trump with half-naked women taken at the site of the pedophile\u2019s rampant sexual abuse of young girls.\nOn author Michael Wolff\u2019s Thursday episode of his podcast Fire and Fury, Wolff shared a recording of a conversation with Epstein from 2017, in which the convicted sex offender and alleged human trafficker recounted Trump\u2019s true feelings about members of his administration, The Daily Beast reported. \n\u201cHis people fight each other and then have outsiders\u2014he sort of poisons the well outside,\u201d Epstein told Wolff. Epstein went on to paraphrase Trump\u2019s candid statements about his former strategist Steve Bannon, former chief of staff Reince Priebus, and counselor Kellyanne Conway.\n\u201cHe will tell 10 people, \u2018Bannon\u2019s a scumbag\u2019 and \u2018Priebus is not doing a good job\u2019 and \u2018Kelly has a big mouth\u2019\u2014what do you think? \u2018Jamie Dimon says that you\u2019re a problem and I shouldn\u2019t keep you. And I spoke to Carl Icahn. And Carl thinks I need a new spokesperson,\u2019\u201d Epstein said.\n\u201c\u2018So Kelly[anne]\u2014even though I hired Kellyanne\u2019s husband\u2014Kellyanne is just too much of a wildcard.\u2019 And then he tells Bannon, \u2018You know I really want to keep you, but Kellyanne hates you,\u2019\u201d Epstein continued. \nWolff said that he had recordings of roughly \u201c100 hours of Epstein talking about the inner workings of the Trump White House and about his long standing, deep relationship with Donald Trump.\u201d\nEpstein also shared photos from the \u201clate 90s\u201d of Trump surrounded by \u201ctopless young women\u201d at Epstein\u2019s home in Palm Beach, Florida, where the disgraced financier victimized dozens of underage girls alongside his friend Ghislaine Maxwell. \n\u201cAnd in some of the pictures, they\u2019re sitting in his lap,\u201d Wolff said. \u201cI mean, and, and then there\u2019s one I especially remember where there\u2019s a stain, a telltale stain and on the front of Trump\u2019s pants, and the girls are pointing at him and laughing.\u201d\nWolff claimed the FBI discovered the photos in Epstein\u2019s safe when the agency raided his home in 2019, but never released the images to the public. Wolff described the photographs when discussing how he used Epstein as a main source for his book Fire and Fury, which focused on the Trump White House.\nWolff said that Epstein was afraid of Trump, believing that he was \u201ccapable of doing anything.\u201d\nThe Trump campaign dismissed Wolff\u2019s claims in a statement to The Daily Beast. \u201cMichael Wolff is a disgraced writer who routinely fabricates lies in order to sell fiction books because he clearly has no morals or ethics,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement.\n\u201cHe waited until days before the election to make outlandish false smears all in an effort to engage in blatant election interference on behalf of Kamala Harris. He\u2019s a failed journalist that is resorting to lying for attention.\u201d\nLast week, a former model came forward with allegations that Trump had once groped her at a party, as part of a \u201ctwisted game\u201d he was playing with Epstein. Trump recently praised Epstein, calling the sex offender, who died in prison before ever standing trial for sex trafficking charges, a \u201cgood salesman.\u201d\n\u201cHe had some nice assets that he\u2019d throw around, like islands,\u201d Trump said in September, clarifying that he\u2019d never been to Epstein\u2019s infamous hub of sex trafficking. Trump waffled for years on the prospect of releasing files on Epstein\u2019s known associates, and claimed that they likely contained \u201cphony\u201d stuff.\nThis story has been updated.\n\nSomeone on Deb Fischer\u2019s team may want to ask her to identify Nebraska on a map.\nThe incumbent Republican senator, who\u2019s facing a tough race this November, recently put out a campaign ad that described Nebraska as a \u201cgreat place to raise families,\u201d while showing beautiful, sprawling footage of anywhere but Nebraska.\nMost of the footage comes from stock images titled \u201cPatriot American Flag Flies over Anytown, USA,\u201d sourced from various parts of the northeast. The New Republic\u2019s Paige Oamek found one of the clips in the ad comes from a small town in Pennsylvania. \nThe mix-up comes at a dangerous time for Fischer in her race against independent challenger Dan Osborn. The Navy veteran and political outsider is reportedly within just two percentage points of Fischer. This is the closest Nebraska has come to being flipped away from red in years.\nThe Osborn campaign immediately seized on the gaffe. \n\u201cMaybe if Deb spent less time at fancy D.C. fund-raisers schmoozing her big corporate donors, she\u2019d actually be able to recognize the state she\u2019s running for Senate in,\u201d Osborn said to The New York Times. \u201cSince Deb so badly wants a New England vacation, Nebraskans will happily fire her on Nov. 5.\u201d\nThe Osborn campaign also called back to Fischer\u2019s prior uses of inaccurate stock footage to portray Nebraska, namely Ukraine and Romania. \nOn Thursday, a spokesman for Fischer faulted a \u201cscrew-up by a vendor\u201d for the error. \n\nJD Vance\u2019s understanding of abortion rights in this country is so off-base that Joe Rogan had to correct him multiple times when he sat down for an interview for his podcast.\nIn a three-hour interview released Thursday, Rogan pressed the Republican vice presidential nominee on abortion, mentioning state laws prohibiting abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, citing Texas as an example, and noted that women in such cases who travel out of state for an abortion could be subject to prosecution. \n\u201cThat\u2019s concerning to me, if there\u2019s a place in the country where it\u2019s legal to have a medical procedure and you live in a state where it\u2019s not legal that your state can decide what you can and can\u2019t do with your body, which is essentially based on a religious idea,\u201d Rogan said. \nVance seemed unfamiliar with such laws. \n\u201cI don\u2019t like the idea, to be clear. I\u2019ve not heard of this, maybe as like a possibility, but not as something that actually exists in the law, but I\u2019ve not heard of somebody being arrested, and I don\u2019t like the idea of arresting people for moving about the country,\u201d Vance said.\nRogan: The concern is men are making decisions on what women can do. Some states have extreme laws that put women in vulnerable positions and if they go to another state, they could then be prosecuted. It\u2019s concerningVance: I haven\u2019t heard of this as something that actually\u2026 pic.twitter.com/fzjMEMyML6\nThe reality is that around the country, many women have had to flee the state to get even a medically necessary abortion, as was the case for Kate Cox in Texas in December. In Texas, many cities and counties have passed ordinances banning people from traveling outside the state for an abortion\u2014which seems to be the new front in the attack on reproductive rights.\nVance\u2019s\u00a0 interview continued on the topic, but things didn\u2019t get better for him. \nRogan mentioned how Roe v. Wade was considered the law of the land, but that was quickly ended by the Supreme Court, and now \u201cyou have these religious men who are trying to dictate what women can or cannot do with their bodies.\u201d\n\u201cI understand the pushback against that, but I think you can go, like with so many other issues, you can go way too far about it, and it becomes trying to celebrate\u201d abortion, Vance responded. \u201cAt the very best, if you grant I think every argument of the pro-choice side, it is a neutral thing, not something to be celebrated.\u201d \n\u201cI think there\u2019s very few people who are celebrating, though,\u201d Rogan replied. Vance suddenly agreed, claiming that echo chambers on social media were creating that impression. \nRogan: Roe was the law of the land and all of a sudden that had been taken away and you have these men trying to dictate what women can and cannot do with their bodiesVance: Yeah, yeah... but you have women who go too far and try to celebrate itRogan: Very few do that pic.twitter.com/Yb7xmPMq74\nVance\u2019s time with Rogan seemed to gloss over what he has actually said and proposed about abortion rights. Shortly after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, Vance seemed to celebrate its demise on a right-wing radio show, even comparing abortion to slavery. Earlier this month, he touted Donald Trump\u2019s abortion policies, claiming that the former president would end federal funding for Planned Parenthood if he wins the election. \nVance tried to convey some kind of level-headed viewpoint on abortion, but seemed unable to address very real abortion scenarios that women face in many states. Will voters take this into account as they head to the polls?\n\nJD Vance claimed that he and Donald Trump could likely win the votes of \u201cnormal\u201d gay men because they \u201cjust want to be left the hell alone.\u201d \nVance appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience for a three-hour interview released Thursday, discussing everything from Emily in Paris to him standing at his front door for an hour with a loaded gun after the first Trump assassination attempt. \nBut one of the wildest moments in the interview came when Vance told Rogan he believed he and Trump would win the \u201cnormal gay guy vote\u201d due to the \u201cextremist religion\u201d of \u201cwokeness.\u201d\n\u201cFrankly, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if me and Trump won just the normal gay guy vote, because again, they just want to be left the hell alone,\u201d Vance said. \u201cAnd now you have all this crazy stuff on top of it that they\u2019re like \u2018No, no \u2026 we didn\u2019t want to give pharmaceutical products to 9-year-olds who are transitioning their genders.\u2019\u201d \nRogan then went on to discuss how it\u2019s actually the transgender movement that\u2019s homophobic, pushing some of his most outlandish anti-trans views yet. \nAmericans everywhere had the same question: What exactly is a \u201cnormal\u201d gay man to Vance? \n\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing gays love, it\u2019s being classified by straights as either \u2018normal\u2019 or \u2018abnormal,\u2019\u201d YouTuber JJ McCollugh tweeted. \nFormer Republican turned liberal pundit Ron Fillipowski asked, \u201cVance says Trump is going to win \u2018the normal gay guy vote.\u2019 Like George Santos maybe? ... Or does he mean all the closeted Republicans who are married to women?\u201d Reality TV host Andy Cohen simply tweeted \u201cSashay away.\u201d \nVance\u2019s comment, and the long-winded transphobic rant that followed, reveals the innate disdain he holds toward LGBTQ people. But Vance is likely to dismiss it as perfectly normal talk. Maybe he\u2019ll remind us all not to get so offended again."

    "content": "\u201cThe race for the White House is too close for comfort,\u201d write parties from around Europe, calling on Stein to throw her support behind Democrat Kamala Harris.\t\t\t\nGreen politicians from across Europe on Friday called on U.S. Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein to withdraw from the race for the White House and endorse Democrat Kamala Harris instead.\n\u201cWe are clear that Kamala Harris is the only candidate who can block Donald Trump and his anti-democratic, authoritarian policies from the White House,\u201d Green parties from countries including Germany, France, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Ireland, Estonia, Belgium, Spain, Poland and Ukraine said in a\u00a0statement, which was shared with POLITICO ahead of publication.\nStein is on the ballot\u00a0in\u00a0almost every critical U.S. state\u00a0and polls between 1.1 percent and 1.4 percent, meaning her candidacy could cost Harris critical votes in the tight race for the White House.\n\u201cRight now, the race for the White House is too close for comfort,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe call on Jill Stein to withdraw from the race, and endorse Kamala Harris for the presidency of the United States.\u201d\nBut with the election just days away \u2014 voters head to the polls on Nov. 5 \u2014 and the relationship between Europe\u2019s Greens and Stein\u2019s party strained, the plea seems unlikely to sway her.\n\u201cWe are committed to this campaign for the presidency and we would never betray our legion of supporters \u2014 and the many supporters who have already cast votes \u2014 by abandoning our mission now, regardless of which anti-democratic person or group makes the suggestion,\u201d Stein\u2019s team said in a statement. \u201cGrassroots democracy is a core tenet of the Green movement worldwide, and for one group of Greens to tell another to stop participating in democracy is disappointing and unprincipled.\u201d\nFriday\u2019s statement from the European Greens highlighted the \u201cdivergent values and policies\u201d of the European and U.S. Greens, noting \u201cthere is no link between the two as the US Greens are no longer a member of the global organization of Green parties.\u201d\nThe statement attributes the \u201cfissure\u201d to the American party\u2019s \u201crelationship with parties with authoritarian leaders, and serious policy differences on key issues including Russia\u2019s full-scale assault on Ukraine.\u201d\nStein was criticized for attending a 2015 dinner in Moscow sponsored by Russian state television network RT, where she sat at the same table as President Vladimir Putin. In its statement, the Stein team dismissed the criticism as a \u201csmear,\u201d pointing to the Green candidate\u2019s X post on the matter a year ago.\nThis story was updated with a statement from the Stein campaign.\nRapid reaction force readies action on trade aimed at forcing Donald Trump to the negotiating table.\nRussian information warriors identified Germany as a particularly easy target for Moscow\u2019s influence, U.S. law enforcement said. \nSpanish leader will be quietly delighted that the Catalan separatist is far away in Belgium, rather than in jail as a martyr. \nIncreasingly exasperated by Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s obstruction of EU foreign policy, Brussels\u00a0is contemplating an unprecedented step to boycott Hungary\u2019s foreign affairs summit next month."

    "publish_date": "2024-11-04T02:04:33+00:00",
    "content": "By Gregory Krieg and Kate Sullivan, CNN\n(CNN) \u2014 Donald Trump, who said in Pennsylvania on Sunday that he regrets leaving the White House in 2021, is ending the 2024 campaign the way he began it \u2014 dishing out a stew of violent, disparaging rhetoric and repeated warnings that he will not accept defeat if it comes.\nAt a rally in the must-win battleground state, the former president told supporters that he \u201cshouldn\u2019t have left\u201d office after losing the 2020 election; described Democrats as \u201cdemonic\u201d; complained about a new poll that shows him no longer leading in Iowa, a state he twice carried; and said he wouldn\u2019t mind if a gunman aiming at him also shot through \u201cthe fake news.\u201d\nTrump spent much of his speech pushing unfounded claims of cheating by Democrats in the 2024 election and sowing doubts about its integrity as polls show him and Vice President Kamala Harris deadlocked nationally. He ranted about alleged election interference this year and lamented his departure from office after losing to Joe Biden four years ago.\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have left. I mean, honestly, because we did so, we did so well,\u201d Trump said during his rally in Lititz as he claimed the US-Mexico border was more secure under his administration.\nIt was a rare public admission of regret over participating in the peaceful transfer of power after he incited his supporters to violently storm the US Capitol as he tried to subvert the results of the 2020 election that he lost but refused to concede \u2014 something Trump is currently facing federal charges over.\nTrump, whose voice sounded hoarse throughout his speech, repeatedly railed against the new Iowa survey released Saturday night, which showed no clear leader between him and Harris in the state.\n\u201cWe got all this crap going on with the press and with fake stuff and fake polls,\u201d Trump said, claiming the poll from the Des Moines Register and Mediacom was put out by \u201cone of my enemies.\u201d\nThe poll delivered a gut punch to those inside Trump\u2019s orbit Saturday night, several people familiar with the reaction told CNN. The former president has been fuming privately over the numbers, arguing the highly anticipated poll should never have been released.\nTrump\u2019s advisers have sought to assure him the survey is not accurate, blasting it as way off and telling him there\u2019s always one poll that stands out. His long-standing pollster issued a memo Saturday night arguing it was a \u201cclear outlier.\u201d But the gender breakdown showing that women are driving a shift toward Harris has privately concerned Trump\u2019s allies, with a focus on the poll\u2019s finding that women in Iowa favor Harris over him, 56% to 36%.\nAt another point during his Lititz rally, the former president, who has been the target of two assassination attempts, suggested he\u2019d be OK with a gunman aiming at him also shooting through the \u201cthe fake news.\u201d\n\u201cI have this piece of glass here. But all we have really over here is the fake news, right? And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t mind that so much. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d\nA Trump campaign spokesman said after the rally that the former president was actually musing about how the press was protecting him.\n\u201cPresident Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also. There can be no other interpretation of what was said. He was actually looking out for their welfare, far more than his own!\u201d Steven Cheung said in a statement.\nResponding to Trump\u2019s comments Sunday, a senior Harris campaign official said in a call with reporters that \u201cfor Trump, this election really is all about his own grievances and he\u2019s not focused on the American people.\u201d\nIn his speech, Trump baselessly claimed Democrats are \u201cfighting so hard to steal this damn thing,\u201d and that voting machines would be tampered with.\n\u201cThey spend all this money, all this money on machines, and they\u2019re going to say, we may take an extra 12 days to determine. And what do you think happens during that 12 days? What do you think happens?\u201d Trump said.\nThe crowd yelled back: \u201cCheating!\u201d\n\u201cThese elections have to be, they have to be decided by 9 o\u2019clock, 10 o\u2019clock, 11 o\u2019clock on Tuesday night. Bunch of crooked people, these are crooked people,\u201d Trump said.\nThe former president\u2019s newest round of threats caps off a campaign with one of the darkest, most menacing closing messages in modern American history. In the last few weeks alone, Trump has doubled down on a pledge to use the military to combat the civilian \u201cenemy within\u201d and mused \u2014 in the guise of arguing he was the pro-peace candidate \u2014 about how former Rep. Liz Cheney, one of his loudest conservative Republican critics, would fare with guns \u201ctrained on her face\u201d in a war zone.\nThis weekend has brought its own slate of bizarre moments. On Sunday, Trump told NBC News that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s recent post on X about removing fluoride from public water if Trump were to win a second term \u201csounds OK to me.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I haven\u2019t talked to him about it yet, but it sounds OK to me,\u201d Trump told NBC. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s possible.\u201d\nAnd a night earlier in North Carolina, Trump chuckled approvingly at an audience member\u2019s suggestion that Harris worked as a prostitute. After Trump insisted yet again that Harris did not work in a McDonald\u2019s when she was younger, a supporter in Greensboro shouted, \u201cShe worked on a corner!\u201d\nTrump laughed, paused for a beat, then declared, \u201cThis place is amazing.\u201d\nAs the crowd laughed, he added: \u201cJust remember it\u2019s other people saying it, it\u2019s not me.\u201d\nHis response to the crude remark underscored how the rot in American political discourse, a long-running spiral, went into overdrive after Trump\u2019s arrival on the presidential campaign trail in 2015. It\u2019s a contrast from seven years earlier, when a supporter of John McCain said during a campaign event that Barack Obama was lying about his identity, claiming, \u201cHe\u2019s an Arab,\u201d and the then-GOP nominee took the microphone from her hands, insisting his rival was \u201ca decent family man (and) citizen that just I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues.\u201d\nEven then, though, Trump was lurking. He would soon emerge as one of the leading proponents of the \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy theory, a racist narrative that said Obama was not born in the US.\nIn the run-up to this year\u2019s election, Trump has used the former president\u2019s full name \u2014 Barack Hussein Obama \u2014 in an attempt to demonize him. He frequently mispronounces Harris\u2019 first name, though he has shown before he knows the proper way to say it, and called her a \u201csh*t vice president.\u201d\nAt other times, Trump has descended into farce. During a rally in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, last month, he spent some time recalling the late, great golfer Arnold Palmer\u2019s naked body.\n\u201cArnold Palmer was all man, and I say that in all due respect to women, I love women,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis man was strong and tough, and I refused to say it, but when he took showers with the other pros they came out of there, they said, \u2018Oh, my God. That\u2019s unbelievable.\u2019\u201d\nTrump\u2019s message to \u2014 and more often, about \u2014 women has also become increasingly bizarre. At a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, last week, he told the crowd that his aides had asked him to stop saying he would be the \u201cprotector\u201d of American women, in part because they recognized it as inappropriate.\n\u201c\u2018Sir, please don\u2019t say that,\u2019\u201d Trump said he was advised. \u201cWhy? I\u2019m president. I want to protect the women of our country. Well, I\u2019m going to do it, whether the women like it or not.\u201d\nRecent polls have shown the former president trailing Harris with female voters by a significant margin across demographic lines. Neither Trump nor his allies have pushed back on the numbers, instead imploring more men to vote.\n\u201cEarly vote has been disproportionately female,\u201d said Charlie Kirk, the leader of a right-wing group that Trump has entrusted with managing much of his ground game. \u201cIf men stay at home, Kamala is president. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d\nHarris has mostly countered Trump\u2019s bleak offerings with promises to bring an end to the tribal clashes that have defined most of the past decade.\n\u201cOur democracy doesn\u2019t require us to agree on everything. That\u2019s not the American way,\u201d Harris said during a speech last week from the Ellipse in Washington, DC. \u201cWe like a good debate. And the fact that someone disagrees with us, does not make them \u2018the enemy from within.\u2019 They are family, neighbors, classmates, coworkers.\u201d\n\u201cIt can be easy to forget a simple truth,\u201d she added. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way.\u201d\nThe vice president has also zeroed in on Trump\u2019s attacks on rivals and detractors, including a persistent insistence he wants to use the power of the federal government to punish them. By contrast, Harris likes to say, she is focused on policy, like a push to restore federal abortion rights following the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\u201cOn day one, if elected, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list,\u201d Harris said in Washington. \u201cWhen elected, I will walk in with a to-do list full of priorities on what I will get done for the American people.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\nCNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins and Samantha Waldenberg contributed to this report.\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "content": "LITITZ, Pennsylvania — Donald Trump said Sunday that he wouldn’t “mind” if someone had to “shoot through the fake news” to get to him, a further escalation of his violent rhetoric. The former president, speaking at a rally here about the efforts the Secret Service has taken to protect him after two apparent assassination attempts against him, began pointing out the panes of ballistic glass surrounding him at the outdoor venue. “All we really have over here is the fake news, right? And to get me somebody would have to shoot through the fake news,” Trump said. “And I don’t mind that so much.” The comment, which drew laughter from the crowd, was one of several broadsides Trump launched against the press in his rally here. He has long used the media as a foil in his appeals to his base. In a statement, campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung denied that Trump was wishing harm upon the media. President Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life, including one that came within 1/4 of an inch from killing him, something that the Media constantly talks and jokes about,” Cheung said. “The President’s statement about protective glass placement has nothing to do with the Media being harmed, or anything else.” Cheung claimed that the former president was really implying the media was in danger and “should have had a glass protective shield, also.” But his remarks Sunday came as Trump has been escalating both his attacks on the press and his use of violent rhetoric in the closing days of his third presidential campaign. The former president last week suggested Republican former Rep. Liz Cheney, who is supporting his rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, should “face nine barrels shooting at her” in an apparent attack on her hawkish views. Trump also said during his speech that he should “never have left” the White House following his loss to President Joe Biden in 2020, continuing his false claim that he won that race. “We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left. I shouldn’t have left,” Trump said. “I mean honestly, because we did so, we did so well, we had such a great, so now, I mean every, every polling booth has hundreds of lawyers standing there. It’s all about the lawyers.” Trump has adamantly claimed — falsely — that he beat Biden since his loss. His supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, during the certification of Biden’s victory, fueled by claims of fraud and the false belief that Trump won the election."

Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.\nAt such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground.

And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.\nDonald Trump made a last-ditch play to save his campaign\u2019s flagging numbers in Pennsylvania but instead spent part of a rally telling his supporters he did not \u201cmind\u201d if journalists were shot. \nThe ex-president was in Lititz for an outdoor rally on Sunday. Bolstered by her opponent\u2019s flagging poll numbers across the board, Kamala Harris is going for the jugular with a final push of campaigning alongside an all-star lineup aimed at pushing herself over the top in several key swing states.\nPennsylvania, which Trump won in 2016 and then lost to Biden (along with the presidency) in 2020, is one of them. The vice president\u2019s campaign is spread across the state, too, ahead of Election Day.\nAt his rally on Sunday, Trump appeared to be tiring to some degree, and in a quieter tone than he has at other events described at one point how a would-be assassin would have to fire through a nearby riser of journalists to reach him. One of two assassination attempts against the ex-president\u2019s life was carried out in Pennsylvania this summer.\n\u201cI have a piece of glass here...But all we have really over here is the fake news. And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t mind that so much.

And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don't mind that so much. I don't mind that.\" pic.twitter.com/V95vb05Jez\nHis campaign put out a statement in response claiming that Trump was actually talking about his concerns for the safety of journalists at the rally \u2014 an obviously false statement, as Trump himself had said he didn\u2019t \u201cmind\u201d that horrifying scenario playing out. Twice.\n\u201cPresident Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life, including one that came within 1/4 of an inch from killing him, something that the Media constantly talks and jokes about. The President\u2019s statement about protective glass placement has nothing to do with the Media being harmed, or anything else,\u201d argued Steven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesman.\nCheung added of Trump\u2019s remarks: \u201cIt was about threats against him that were spurred on by dangerous rhetoric from Democrats. In fact, President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also. There can be no other interpretation of what was said. He was actually looking out for their welfare, far more than his own!\"\nIt isn\u2019t the first time even in the past week that Donald Trump has vocalized one of his apparently violent fantasies while his campaign and various allies have tried to paper over it and pretend like his remarks don\u2019t exist.\nOf his Republican critic Liz Cheney, he said on Thursday: \u201cShe\u2019s a radical war hawk. Let\u2019s put her with the rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her. OK, let\u2019s see how she feels about it. You know, when the guns are trained on her face.\u201d\nTrump has also expressed a desire to see protesters beaten up at his rallies \u2014 several protesters have since been beaten up at his rallies as they were carried out by security.\nHis anger at his political enemies has only grown in the weeks leading up to Election Day, though his language aimed at Democrats and virtually anyone who opposes him from a political standpoint crossed the boundary into dehumanization months ago.\nHe has, this year, called Democrats \u201cnot people\u201d in \u201csome cases\u201d as well as the \u201cenemies within\u201d \u2014 in the latter case, naming several Democrats specifically, including Nancy Pelosi, to whom he said that phrase applied. The ex-president also threatened to call out the military against protesters in the United States. \nOn Sunday, he called the entire party \u201cdemonic\u201d, told voters he shouldn\u2019t have left office in 2021 after the assault on the US Capitol and his election defeat, while vowing a new personal grudge against Michelle Obama: \u201cI think we're gonna start having a little fun with Michelle.\"\nVoters are set to decide if he will have the keys to the White House in less than 48 hours.\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nPlease refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged inPlease refresh your browser to be logged in"

I mean, honestly, because we did so well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said about 15 minutes into his more than 90-minute remarks at an airport in Lititz, Pa. He called the United States \u00e2\u0080\u009ca crooked country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d promising that \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to make it straight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI tell you what, I love being off these stupid teleprompters, because the truth comes out. The truth comes out, and at least you find out that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.\nAt one point, as he discussed the protective ballistic glass that surrounds him at rallies since the two assassination attempts on his life earlier this year, Trump said that if someone wanted to shoot him, they would have to \u00e2\u0080\u009cshoot through the fake news\u00e2\u0080\u009d positioned across from him at the rally.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind that so much. I don't mind. I don't mind that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said, as the crowd cheered and laughed. He later called the press \u00e2\u0080\u009cfake,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cworse than the politicians\u00e2\u0080\u009d and re-upped his public consideration of\u00a0stripping broadcast TV news networks of their licenses\u00a0for coverage he dislikes.\u00a0\nTrump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign issued a statement after the rally arguing Trump was not talking about the media getting shot and claimed that he was \u00e2\u0080\u009cstating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung also blamed Democrats for the two assassination attempts.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPresident Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life, including one that came within 1/4 of an inch from killing him, something that the Media constantly talks and jokes about. The President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s statement about protective glass placement has nothing to do with the Media being harmed, or anything else,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cheung said in the statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere can be no other interpretation of what was said. He was actually looking out for their welfare, far more than his own!\"\nIt was the second time in recent days that Trump has talked about guns being pointed at people he considers enemies after\u00a0he suggested\u00a0former Rep. Liz Cheney, a prominent Republican critic, wouldn't be willing to support foreign wars if she had \u00e2\u0080\u009cnine barrels shooting at her.\nTrump has brought up complaints, criticisms and falsehoods about election integrity in the United States with increasing frequency as Election Day rapidly approaches. On Sunday, the second-to-last day of campaigning before Tuesday, Trump used his first stop of the day to rail against his political foes -- including Vice President Kamala Harris, Democrats, former administration officials-turned-critics, the press, and pollsters -- and falsely accuse them of \u00e2\u0080\u009cfighting so hard to steal this damn thing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm the only one that talks about it, because everyone's afraid to damn talk about it, and then they accuse you of being a conspiracy theorist, \u00e2\u0080\u0098he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a conspiracy-\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and they want to lock you up. They want to put you in jail,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe ones that should be locked up by the ones that cheat on these horrible elections that we go through in our country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe former president called Harris \u00e2\u0080\u009ca totally corrupt person,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00a0spread false claims\u00a0about voter fraud in Pennsylvania\u00e2\u0080\u0099s populous Lancaster County, and shared deep doubts about the integrity of U.S. election systems as millions of Americans have already voted.\u00a0\nSome of his allies, notably former chief strategist Steve Bannon, have encouraged him to prematurely declare victory on Tuesday even if the race is too early to call. That's what Trump did four years ago, kicking off a process of fighting the election results that culminated in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\nAfter speaking at a church service in Detroit on Sunday, Harris pushed back at Trump's characterizations of U.S. elections, telling reporters after the church service that Trump's comments are \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeant to distract from the fact that we have and support free and fair elections in our country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Those \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood systems\u00e2\u0080\u009d were in place in 2020, Harris said, and \u00e2\u0080\u009che lost.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe vice president said she trusts the upcoming vote tally and urged voters, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin particular people who have not yet voted to not fall for this tactic, which I think includes, suggesting to people that if they vote, their vote won't matter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHarris' campaign said that Trump \"is spending the closing days of his campaign angry and unhinged, lying about the election being stolen because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worried he will lose.\"\n\"The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth and will walk into the Oval Office focused on them \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Vice President Harris,\" said Harris campaign rapid response director Ammar Moussa.\nAt the Pennsylvania rally, Trump also called his former national security advisor John Bolton a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdumb son of a b---,\u00e2\u0080\u009d California Rep. Adam Schiff \u00e2\u0080\u009can ugly guy, both inside and out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and said he was going to \u00e2\u0080\u009cstart having a little fun with Michelle\u00e2\u0080\u009d Obama after taking onus with\u00a0her criticism of him on the trail.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI've always treated his wife with great respect, but she came at me the other day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said, during an aside about President Barack Obama. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat's not nice of her to do. And I think we're going to start having a little fun with Michelle. I think we're gonna have a little fun with Michelle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nTrump also criticized an unnamed news network that cuts off his speeches \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you even mention the fact that there's cheating and elections\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 after\u00a0criticizing friendly Fox News\u00a0for airing Democratic criticisms of him earlier in the day\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 and called Iowa pollster J. Ann Selzer \u00e2\u0080\u009cone of my enemies\u00e2\u0080\u009d after\u00a0a Des Moines Register poll\u00a0found Harris leading 47% to 44% in the typically red state.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey just announced a fake poll. Hey, think of it right before the election that I'm three points down. I'm not down in Iowa,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said.\nIowa, which went blue for Barack Obama twice, has tacked to the right in statewide elections since 2012 and was all but assumed to be out of play for Democrats. The poll, conducted for the Des Moines Register by the well-respected Selzer, surveyed 808 likely voters in the state, including those who already voted and those who said they definitely plan to vote, between Oct. 28 and Oct. 31. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.\u00a0\nPrevious Selzer polls, widely considered to be among the best at gauging the moods of Iowans, had Trump\u00a0up four points\u00a0over Harris in September and\u00a0up 18 points\u00a0over then-candidate President Joe Biden in June.\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard for anybody to say they saw this coming,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Selzer told the Register. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe has clearly leaped into a leading position.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWhile it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just one poll \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00a0an Emerson College poll\u00a0of 800 likely voters over the weekend found Trump up nine points in Iowa \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Selzer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00a0reputation\u00a0as\u00a0one of the best pollsters\u00a0in the business contributed to Harris supporters circulating the poll widely on Saturday night as a good sign for the vice president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign. If the poll is accurate, it could be indicative of a wider shift among the electorate in the Midwest in more typical swing states with greater numbers of Electoral College votes than Iowa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s six, former top Obama campaign and White House aide Dan Pfieffer\u00a0speculated on social media\u00a0on Saturday.\u00a0\nOther polls released on Sunday showed a closer race in key swing states, including the top-ranked\u00a0New York Times/Siena College poll\u00a0which found Harris leading by one to three percentage points in Nevada, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Georgia and Trump up 49% to 45% in Arizona. The Times poll has the race tied in Pennsylvania and Michigan. An\u00a0ABC News poll\u00a0showed Harris leading 49% to 46% nationwide among likely voters, with the average across battleground states netting to the same.\u00a0\nPolls from Morning Consult\u00a0also found the race neck-and-neck in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\u00a0\nTrump was scheduled to be in North Carolina on Sunday afternoon and Georgia in the evening.\u00a0\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

Lindsay \n\nDecember 18, 2024 3:14 pm (EST)\n\nElection 2024 is almost over. Electoral College electors convened yesterday in state capitals across the country to cast their votes. The result was what everyone expected, the election of Donald Trump as the forty-seventh president of the United States. With the election now settled\u2014no one expects the certification of the vote to be disrupted on January 6, 2025, as it was in 2021\u2014here is a recap of how the vote went in 2024.\nThe Electoral College\nMore on:\n\nUnited States\n\n\nElections and Voting\n\n\nElection 2024\n\n\nDiamonstein-Spielvogel Project on the Future of Democracy\n\n\nTransition 2025\n\nThe formal vote in the Electoral College went as projected. Trump won 312 votes, and Kamala Harris won 226. Unlike in 2016, when seven electors voted for someone other than the candidate they were pledged to, the 2024 Electoral College vote had no \u201cfaithless electors.\u201d The 312 votes that Trump received was eight votes greater than what he recorded in 2016, though the difference would have been just six if not for two faithless electors.\nA summary of global news developments with CFR analysis delivered to your inbox each morning.\u00a0Weekdays.\nA curation of original analyses, data visualizations, and commentaries, examining the debates and efforts to improve health worldwide.\u00a0Weekly.\nTrump flipped six states on his way to winning the Electoral College: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Every other state voted in 2024 as it did in 2020.\nThe Popular Vote \nTrump won 77,284,118 votes, or 49.8 percent of the votes cast for president. That is the second highest vote total in U.S. history, trailing only the 81,284,666 votes that Joe Biden won in 2020. Trump won 3,059,799 more popular votes in 2024 than he won in 2020 and 14,299,293 more than he won in 2016. He now holds the record for the most cumulative popular votes won by any presidential candidate in U.S. history, surpassing Barack Obama. Running three times for the White House obviously helps. \nKamala Harris won 74,999,166 votes or 48.3 percent of the votes cast. That was 6,285,500 fewer popular votes than Biden won in 2020, but 774,847 more than Trump won in 2020.\nMore than 155 million Americans voted in 2024: 156,302,318 to be exact. That\u2019s the second largest total voter turnout in U.S. history in absolute terms. It is also just the second time that more than 140 million people voted in a presidential election.\nMore on:\n\nUnited States\n\n\nElections and Voting\n\n\nElection 2024\n\n\nDiamonstein-Spielvogel Project on the Future of Democracy\n\n\nTransition 2025\n\nIn relative terms, voter turnout nationally in 2024 was 63.9 percent. That is below the 66.6 percent voter turnout recorded in 2020, which was the highest voter turnout rate in a U.S. presidential election since 1900. Nonetheless, turnout in 2024 was still high by modern standards. The 1960 election between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon (63.8 percent) is the only other election in the last 112 years to exceed 63 percent voter turnout. If you are wondering, the election of 1876 holds the record for the highest percentage voter turnout: 82.6 percent. That was one of America\u2019s most controversial and consequential elections\u2014and not in a good way. It was also an election in which more than half the adult-age population was ineligible to vote.\nWisconsin holds the place of pride as the state with the highest voter turnout in 2024\u201476.93 percent of eligible voters in the Badger State voted. Five of the six battleground states that switched from Biden to Trump saw their turnout exceed the national average; only Arizona (63.6 percent) was below, and then just barely. Hawaii holds the distinction of being the state with the lowest voter turnout. Just 50 percent of Hawaiians voted.\nA Landslide Election or Not? \u00a0\nEarly election coverage described Trump\u2019s victory as a landslide. But whether you go by the Electoral College vote or the popular vote, it was anything but. The 312 Electoral College votes that Trump won are just six more than Joe Biden won in 2020, twenty less than Barack Obama won in 2012, and fifty-three less than Obama won in 2008. Trump\u2019s Electoral College performance pales in comparison to Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s landslide victory in 1936 (523 electoral votes), Lyndon Johnson\u2019s in 1964 (486), Richard Nixon\u2019s in 1972 (520), or Ronald Reagan\u2019s in 1984 (525). In terms of the popular vote, more people voted for someone not named Trump for president than voted for Trump in 2024, and his margin of victory over Harris was 1.5 percentage points. That is the fifth smallest margin of victory in the thirty-two presidential races held since 1900.\nAnother way to think about whether the election was a landslide or not is to determine how many popular votes needed to shift to change the outcome. As John Quincy Adams, Rutherford B. Hayes, Benjamin Harrison, George W. Bush, and Trump himself can attest, you do not need to win the popular vote to win the presidency. If Harris had picked up the right mix of 229,726 votes in Michigan (80,103), Pennsylvania (120,226), and Wisconsin (29,397), she would be taking the oath of office on January 20. To put that number in comparison, had Hillary Clinton picked up the right mix of 78,000 votes in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, she would have won the Electoral College in 2016. Had Trump picked up the right mix of 65,000 votes in Arizona, Georgia, Wisconsin, and Nebraska's second congressional district, he would have won the Electoral College outright in 2020.\nThe 2024 election was the tenth presidential election in a row in which the margin of victory in the popular vote was in the single digits. That is a record. The longest prior streak began in 1876, when seven consecutive elections were decided by single digits. The last person to win the presidency by a double-digit margin was Ronald Reagan in 1984. He won by eighteen percentage points. The last time someone won the presidency by more than five percentage points was Barack Obama in 2008. He won by seven percentage points. The bottom line is that whatever one makes of the mandate that Trump did or did not win last month, the United States remains deeply divided politically.\nEarly and Mail-in Voting\nEarly and mail-in balloting remained popular in 2024. A total of 88,380,679 were cast. Fifty-two percent of the early votes were cast in person, while 48 percent were by mail-in ballot.\nNot all states track and release early and mail-in ballots by party affiliation. The available data shows that 41 percent of early and mail-in balloting was done by registered Democrats, 38 percent by registered Republicans, and 21 percent by others.\nCongress\nThe good news for Republicans is that they will control both the House and Senate when the new Congress convenes next month. The bad news is that their majorities in both chambers, and especially the House, are small.\nRepublicans won 220 House seats compared to 215 for the Democrats. That majority is two seats smaller than what the Republicans won in the 2022 midterm elections. The Republicans\u2019 margin of control is also set to shrink next month. Representative Matt Gaetz has said he does not plan to return to Congress after withdrawing as Trump\u2019s pick to be attorney general, and Elise Stefanik and Mike Waltz are expected to resign their seats to join the Trump administration. The special elections to fill those seats, which Republican candidates will almost certainly win, will not come until the spring. That means that the House Republican Conference could have difficulties for the next several months moving major legislation. If just one Republican legislator defects, a united Democratic caucus can block action on a bill.\nRepublicans will hold fifty-three seats in the new Senate, a pick-up of four seats. The Republicans last controlled the Senate in 2020. The four seats that flipped were Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. The fifty-three seats the Republicans hold still leaves them well short of the sixty seats needed to have a filibuster-proof majority.\nWomen in Congress \nThe 119th Congress that convenes on January 3 will have 150 women. That means that 27.8 percent of the members of Congress will be women. The total number of women in the next Congress, however, will be down two from the current Congress. That number will rise to three when Elise Stefanik resigns her House seat to be nominated for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. And, yes, women\u2019s representation in Congress continues to lag behind that in the national legislatures of many other democracies.\nThe twenty-five women in the new Senate ties the high set in the 116th Congress (2019-2021). The House will seat 125 women. That is a drop of two\u2014before Stefanik\u2019s resignation\u2014from the current House. The 119th Congress will mark a step backward for women in the House on another dimension. For the first time since the 109th Congress (2005-2006), no woman will chair a House committee. Three women chaired committees in the current Congress. Two of them declined to run for reelection and the third gave up her gavel because of the terms limits that House Republicans impose on committee chairs.\nOne reason for the shortage of women as committee chairs in the House is the discrepancy between the two parties when it comes to women lawmakers. Democrats will have 110 women in the new Congress, which is up two over the 118th Congress. In comparison, Republicans, who are the majority party and select committee chairs from their own membership, will start with forty women in the House and Senate. That total is down three members. Stefanik\u2019s resignation will raise that number to four.\nFifty-nine women of color will serve in the 119th Congress. The record is sixty-one, which is the number in the current Congress. The drop in the number of women of color is the first decrease since the number fell with the 2008 election. Republicans will have five women of color in Congress, while the Democrats will have fifty-four.\nFor the first time in U.S. history, the Senate will have two Black women senators serving simultaneously. Democrat Angela Alsobrooks became the first Black senator elected in Maryland, and Democrat Lisa Blunt Rochester became the first woman and the first Black senator from Delaware.\nSeveral women elected to the House also set firsts. Democrat Yassamin Ansari will be the first woman of Middle Eastern/North African descent to represent Arizona in the U.S. Congress. Democrat Janelle Bynum will be the first black woman to represent Oregon in the U.S. Congress. Republican Julie Fedorchak will be the first woman to represent North Dakota in the U.S. House. (That means that Mississippi stands as the only state to have never sent a woman to the U.S. House.) Democrat Sarah McBride of Delaware will be the first openly transgender member of the House. Democrat Nellie Pou will be the first Latina to represent New Jersey in the House.\nOther Notable Developments \nPeople of color will make up around 27 percent of the new Congress. Excluding non-voting delegates, sixty-five African Americans will serve in the 119th Congress, up five from the 118th Congress; fifty-two Hispanic Americans will serve in the 119th Congress, down one from the 118th Congress; twenty-two Asian Americans will serve in the 119th Congress, up two from the 118th Congress; and four Native Americans will serve in the 119th Congress, one less than in the 118th Congress.\nThe election of Alsobrooks and Blunt Rochester means that the Senate will have five African-American members. The others are Democrats Corey Booker of New Jersey and Raphael Warnock of Georgia, and Republican Tim Scott of South Carolina.\nDemocrat Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Republican Bernie Moreno of Ohio are the two new Hispanic members of the Senate. Once Gallego and Moreno take their oaths of office, the Senate will have six Hispanic members. Democrats Alex Padilla of California, Catherine Cortez Mastro of Nevada, Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n\u00a0of New Mexico and Republican Ted Cruz of Texas are the other Hispanic senators.

See what you missed below and follow today\u2019s live updates.\nVice President Kamala Harris told supporters gathered at Howard University on Wednesday that she had lost the 2024 Election to Donald Trump, conceding to the Republican President-elect after a hard fought campaign.\nHere\u2019s what to know:\n\u25b6 Siga la cobertura de las elecciones de AP en espa\u00f1ol\nWatch live as Kamala Harris delivers her concession speech after Donald Trump was elected the 47th president of the United States.\n\nAP estimated late Wednesday evening that there are more than 200,000 ballots left to count in Nevada \u2013 including more than 130,000 in Clark County. Given the narrow margins in the races for president and U.S. Senate, both are too early to call. \nThe AP will further review results released by Nevada election officials on Thursday.\n\n\n\nOfficials in Arizona\u2019s Maricopa County said late Wednesday they\u2019ve got more than 700,000 ballots left to count, which means races for president and U.S. Senate in the state will remain too early to call for another day. \nIn all, AP estimates there are at least a million ballots to be added to the results in Arizona. County election officials are expected to firm up those numbers on Thursday.\n\n\n\nThe FBI is warning of additional fabricated videos that misuse its name and insignia to undermine confidence in the electoral system.\nOne of the videos falsely claims that the FBI was made aware that at least 301 electors reported attempted bribery and blackmail by a political party.\nAnother video falsely claims that the FBI is investigating voter pressure at US military bases overseas, a third claims that a U.S. social media company has seen an increase in the number of separatist groups to include a total audience of more than 40 million people and the fourth falsely claims that the FBI has ordered media to restrict the spread of information about the bribery of electors.\nThe FBI says each of the videos contains false information.\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has congratulated Trump on his \u201chuge win\u201d and discussed strengthening security and economic cooperation between the allies, according to a Seoul presidential official.\nKim Tae-hyo, Yoon\u2019s deputy national security director, said Thursday that Yoon and Trump also discussed the growing threats posed by nuclear-armed North Korea, including its intercontinental ballistic missiles targeting the U.S. mainland, and its reported provision of troops to Russia in support of Vladimir Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine.\nKim said Trump called for expanding the countries\u2019 cooperation in the shipbuilding industries, highlighting South Korea\u2019s strengths in building warships and vessels, and called for more detailed discussions on improving U.S. competitiveness in ship exports as well as maintenance and repair.\nKim said Yoon and Trump agreed to arrange an in-person meeting soon.\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s office said Trudeau congratulated Trump in a phone call. \u201cThe two leaders discussed the enduring and successful partnership between Canada and the United States,\u201d the statement said. \nThe statement noted that they discussed trade, supply chains, global trading practices and North American security.\nCLAIM: President Joe Biden won approximately 20 million more votes in the 2020 election than Vice President Kamala Harris earned in the 2024 race, proving either that Trump has cheated his way to a second term or that there was widespread fraud four years ago.\nTHE FACTS: The claims are unfounded. Votes from Tuesday\u2019s presidential election are still being counted, so any comparison with previous races would not be accurate. In addition, election officials and agencies monitoring the vote have reported no significant issues with Tuesday\u2019s election. Claims of widespread fraud in 2020 have been debunked countless times.\n\u25b6 Read more about the false claim\nPresident Biden will address the nation Thursday at 11 a.m. EST. The remarks to the nation will be Biden\u2019s first appearance on camera in the aftermath of Donald Trump\u2019s decisive victory over Kamala Harris.\nGolden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr spoke about the election ahead of a game against the Boston Celtics. In August, he coached the U.S. Olympics men\u2019s team to a gold medal in Paris.\n\u201cWell, I believe in democracy, and I think the American people have spoken and voted for Trump, and I want him to do well the next four years. I want our country to do well.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complex world. We\u2019ve got a lot of interesting stuff between wars abroad, a global economy that has shifted everything in terms of what it means for our citizens and their day-to-day lives,\u201d he said. \u201cI want what\u2019s best for us. I hope Trump can deliver.\u201d\nDonald Trump ran a campaign centered on hypermasculinity, actively courting young men in particular with interviews on popular male-centric podcasts.\nIn the closing weeks of the campaign, the former president and many of his surrogates leaned into sexist remarks and jokes about Vice President Kamala Harris.\nSome of his supporters, including former presidential rival Nikki Haley, warned that the former president risked exacerbating his persistent gender gap with Harris. Prominent surrogates from billionaire Elon Musk to Charlie Kirk, founder of the conservative youth organization Turning Point, called on men to vote in large numbers to counter Harris\u2019 expected strength among women.\nIn the end, the gender voting gap was unremarkable by recent historical standards.\n\u25b6 Read more takeaways from AP VoteCast\nTrump has already appointed three Supreme Court justices. In his second term, he could well have a chance to name two more, creating a high court with a Trump-appointed majority that could serve for decades.\nThe decisive outcome spares the court from having to wade into election disputes. It also seems likely to change the tenor of cases that come before the justices, including on abortion and immigration.\nThe two eldest justices \u2014 Clarence Thomas, 76, and Samuel Alito, 74 \u2014 could consider stepping down knowing that Trump, a Republican, would nominate replacements who might be three decades younger and ensure conservative domination of the court through the middle of the century, or beyond.\nRead more about how Trump could further shape the Supreme Court\nFormer President Bill Clinton and former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton wished Trump and running mate JD Vance well on Wednesday, writing that they \u201chope they will govern for all of us.\u201d\nThe Clintons had been some of the most outspoken Democratic critics of Trump. The former Democratic president stumped across the country for Harris and running mate Tim Walz, while the former secretary of state, Trump\u2019s opponent in 2016, had criticized her one-time rival throughout the entire election. The two commended Harris and Walz for running \u201ca positive, forward-looking campaign to be proud of.\u201d\n\u201cWe must remember that America is bigger than the results of any one election, and what we as citizens do now will make the difference between a nation that moves forward and one that falls back,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe need to solve our problems and see our opportunities together. The future of our country depends on it.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s campaign says he has accepted President Biden\u2019s invitation to meet at the White House to discuss the presidential transition. No date has been announced yet but Steven Cheung, Trump\u2019s communications director, said it would \u201ctake place shortly.\u201d Cheung said Trump \u201cvery much appreciated\u201d Biden\u2019s congratulatory call on Wednesday.\nBiden, in a White House-issued statement, praised Harris as \u201ca tremendous partner and public servant full of integrity, courage, and character.\u201d It was Biden\u2019s first public comment in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s victory.\nThe president also noted that Harris entered the campaign under \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d a nod to his dropping out of the race 108 days before Election Day amid growing pressure from within his party after his cataclysmic debate performance against Trump.\nBiden added that Harris \u201cstepped up and led a historic campaign that embodied what\u2019s possible when guided by a strong moral compass and a clear vision for a nation that is more free, more just, and full of more opportunities for all Americans.\u201d\nA disaffected electorate wanted former President Donald Trump to return to the White House, a blatant rejection of Vice President Kamala Harris and her nearly four years with President Joe Biden.\nThe Republican\u2019s victory came from a public so put off by America\u2019s trajectory that they welcomed his brash and disruptive approach. About 3 in 10 voters said they wanted total upheaval in how the country is run, according to AP VoteCast, a sweeping survey of more than 120,000 voters nationwide. Even if they weren\u2019t looking for something that dramatic, more than half of voters overall said they wanted to see substantial change.\n\n\nBoth nationwide and in key battleground states, the Republicans won over voters who were alarmed about the economy and prioritized more aggressive enforcement of immigration laws. Those issues largely overshadowed many voters\u2019 focus on the future of democracy and abortion protections \u2014 key priorities for Harris\u2019 voters, but not enough to turn the election in her favor.\n\u25b6 Learn how this key issue shaped the election\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz listens as Vice President Kamala Harris delivers a concession speech after the 2024 presidential election, Wednesday, Nov. 6, 2024, on the campus of Howard University in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nAs Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz was leaving after his running mate\u2019s concession speech, a reporter asked him: \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d\n\u201cMinnesota,\u201d he answered.\nMelania Trump marked her husband\u2019s win in the 2025 election by saying a \u201cmajority of Americans have entrusted us with this important responsibility.\u201d\nThe former \u2014 and future \u2014 first lady was an infrequent figure on the campaign trail with the Republican candidate. Melania Trump attended but did not speak at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. She did appear at Donald Trump\u2019s election party early on Wednesday morning.\n\u201cWe will safeguard the heart of our republic \u2013 freedom,\u201d Melania Trump wrote. \u201cI anticipate the citizens of our nation rejoining in commitment to each other and rising above ideology for the sake of individual liberty, economic prosperity, and security.\u201d\nFor all the concerns about a tumultuous process that could leave Americans waiting for days to learn who its next president would be, news outlets instead experienced an election night that hewed close to tradition.\nFox News Channel declared Trump had reclaimed the presidency at 1:47 a.m. on Wednesday. Broadcast networks and The Associated Press had Trump on the precipice of returning to the presidency when he took the stage in Florida at 2:25 a.m. to declare victory.\nMany journalists warned viewers that determining the winner could be a protracted process that could take several days like it had in 2020.\nYet from the first hints provided by exit poll results shortly after 5 p.m. EST, the election night story moved methodically in Trump\u2019s direction.\n\u25b6 Read more about how the media covered election night\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement late Wednesday, saying that \u201cwe all pray for America\u2019s success under the next administration,\u201d but did not make mention of Trump by name.\nPelosi was seen as the architect of the Democratic party\u2019s strategic shift from Joe Biden to Kamala Harris as top of their ticket over the summer. The California Democrat has been Trump\u2019s biggest critic, saying previously that her goal is to ensure Trump never enters the White House again.\n\u201cThe peaceful transfer of power is the cornerstone of our democracy,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cAfter every election, we all have a responsibility to come together and find common ground.\u201d\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence congratulated Trump for winning a second term in office, writing yet another awkward chapter in the relationship between the president-elect and his former running mate.\n\u201cThe American people have spoken and Karen and I send our sincere congratulations to President-Elect Donald Trump and his family on his election as 47th President of the United States,\u201d Pence wrote on behalf of him and his wife. The former vice president also congratulated Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who ran in place of Pence as Trump\u2019s running mate.\n\u201cWe will continue to pray for all those in authority and urge every American to join us in praying for our incoming President, Vice President and elected officials at every level,\u201d Pence concluded.\nPence\u2019s relationship with Trump fractured after the former vice president declined to follow the Republican president\u2019s wishes and went ahead with certifying the 2020 election. Trump did not hold back in his contempt for Pence, questioning his judgment and calling him \u201cdelusional\u201d on the campaign trail. Pence, in turn, declined to endorse his one-time running mate.\nRepublican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump arrives at an election night watch party at the Palm Beach Convention Center, Wednesday, Nov. 6, 2024, in West Palm Beach, Fla. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nAmerican presidential elections are a moment when the nation holds up a mirror to look at itself. They are a reflection of values and dreams, of grievances and scores to be settled.\nThe results say much about a country\u2019s character, future and core beliefs. On Tuesday, America looked into that mirror and more voters saw former president Donald Trump, delivering him a far-reaching victory in the most contested states.\nHe won for many reasons. One of them was that a formidable number of Americans, from different angles, said the state of democracy was a prime concern.\nEven as Trump prevailed, most voters said they were very or somewhat concerned that electing Trump would bring the U.S. closer to being an authoritarian country, where a single leader has unchecked power, according to the AP VoteCast survey. Still, 1 in 10 of those voters backed him anyway. Nearly 4 in 10 Trump voters said they wanted complete upheaval in how the country is run.\n\u25b6 Read more about Trump\u2019s plans for American democracy\nThey\u2019re called swing states for a reason.\nOn Tuesday, Trump led the Republican ticket to a sweeping national victory. He was on track to improve upon his 2020 vote performance in 48 states. This included bringing back into the fold the five states that had abandoned him for Democratic Joe Biden four years ago.\n\n\nSix of the seven 2024 presidential battlegrounds that helped decide Tuesday\u2019s election had all moved sharply away from Trump in 2020. They included Georgia and Arizona, which hadn\u2019t supported a Democrat for president in more than 20 years, as well as North Carolina, which shifted sharply to the left but barely remained in Trump\u2019s column in 2020.\nPennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin all supported Trump in 2016 after supporting Democratic presidential candidates for at least six consecutive elections but swung back toward Democrats in 2020.\n\n\nThis year, Trump significantly outperformed his 2020 showing in all battlegrounds and had either won or was leading in the vote in the count as of Wednesday afternoon.\nNevada maintained a 2.4 percentage-point advantage for the Democratic candidate in both 2016 and 2020. But Trump led by almost 5 percentage points on Wednesday, although the AP had not yet called the race.\nThe election of Donald Trump as president for a second time and the Republican takeback of the U.S. Senate could undo many of the national climate policies that are most reducing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to climate solutions experts.\nWhen they list measures that are making the most difference, it lines up with policies Trump has said he\u2019ll target.\nThese rollbacks will come as more lives are being lost in heat waves, record amounts of climate pollution are accumulating in the atmosphere, the United States has been hit with what may be two of its most expensive hurricanes, and nations, which will meet in Baku, Azerbaijan next week for climate negotiations, have failed to take strong action to change these realities.\n\u25b6 Read about some of the measures\nIn a statement issued Wednesday, former President Barack Obama, along with former first lady Michelle Obama, said the election\u2019s result \u201cis obviously not the outcome we had hoped for\u201d but noted that \u201cliving in a democracy is about recognizing that our point of view won\u2019t always win out, and being willing to accept the peaceful transfer of power.\u201d\nCongratulating Trump and Vance, the Obamas expressed pride for Harris and Walz, for both of whom they campaigned, calling them \u201ctwo extraordinary public servants who ran a remarkable campaign.\u201d\nThe Obamas cast forward with hope for a divided America, saying that the nation\u2019s problems are solvable \u201conly if we listen to each other, and only if we abide by the core constitutional principles and democratic norms that made this country great.\u201d\nThe White House is encouraging Trump to enter into the required agreements necessary to begin an orderly presidential transition.\nTrump\u2019s transition team still has not signed the agreements with the White House and the General Services Administration that allow them access to federal facilities, documents and personnel. The delay is holding up the federal government\u2019s ability to begin processing security clearances for potential Trump administration national security appointees, potentially limiting the number of his staff who could work on sensitive information by Inauguration Day.\nWhite House chief of staff Jeff Zients reached out to co-chairs Howard Lutnick and Linda McMahon to reiterate the role the agreements play in beginning a presidential transition, according to a White House official. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive transition planning.\nShortly after Harris\u2019 concession speech, a series of Democratic lawmakers issued their first statements in response to the election results and promised to ensure a \u201cpeaceful\u201d transition for the incoming Republican administration.\n\u201cAs deeply, deeply disappointed as I am by the results of the election, make no mistake: my Democratic colleagues and I \u2014 unlike many Republicans after the 2020 election \u2014 will uphold the will of the American people, fulfill our constitutional duty and do our part to ensure a peaceful transfer of power,\u201d Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois said in a statement.\nTransition talks have not yet begun in earnest, according to a person with knowledge of the Trump campaign. Instead, the president-elect was busy taking calls from leaders, domestic and international, donors and key supporters. Transition discussions are expected to ramp up later in the week, as attention turns to naming an inaugural committee and formal transition team. The person was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\nNevada resumed counting votes on Wednesday afternoon, adding almost 21,000 votes including 9,000 from Clark County. Trump\u2019s lead in the state is about 560,000 votes, and the race is too early to call. Clark, home to Las Vegas, has the greatest number of ballots left to be counted. Election officials in Clark plan for another update late Wednesday and to update daily at 11 p.m. EST through Saturday.\nVice President Kamala Harris delivers a concession speech for the 2024 presidential election, Wednesday, Nov. 6, 2024, on the campus of Howard University in Washington.

Ro Khanna, D-Calif., among the few Democrats with presidential ambitions to address the party\u2019s future on Wednesday. \u201cThere needs to be new thinking, new ideas and a new direction. And, you know, the establishment produced a disaster.\u201d\n\u25b6 Read more about the Democrats\u2019 future\nFormer President Donald Trump won Alaska and its three electoral votes on Wednesday, adding to his lead in the Electoral College. Trump continues a decadeslong trend of Republicans carrying the state in the presidential race. When discussing Alaska, he has often cited his role while president in the passage of a 2017 tax law that called for oil and gas leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Trump endorsed in Alaska\u2019s other high-profile race this election cycle, backing Republican Nick Begich for U.S. House. The Associated Press declared Trump the winner at 4:59 p.m. EST.\nMore than 70 national, state and local LGBTQ+ rights and advocacy organizations released a \u201csolidarity statement\u201d Wednesday reacting to the results of this week\u2019s elections.\n\u201cElection outcomes at national, state, and local levels will impact our health, our safety, and our rights as LGBTQIA2S+ people and families,\u201d the statement read. \u201cDespite anti-LGBTQIA2S+ efforts to divide our communities, and particularly severe attacks against transgender people and LGBTQIA2S+ youth, we have succeeded in moving a few steps closer toward equity and justice for our community.\u201d\nThe letter highlighted the reelection of lesbian U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and the election of the first transgender member of Congress, Rep.-elect Sarah McBride, of Delaware.\nThe statement did not mention Trump by name. But he and other Republican candidates frequently employed anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric in campaign ads, remarks and platforms, particularly against transgender and nonbinary people.\nThe statement was signed by groups including the National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, GLAAD, many PFLAG and Equality chapters, the Transgender Law Center, Advocates for Trans Equality, and the Trevor Project, a youth suicide prevention organization.\nJaymes Black, CEO of the Trevor Project, said separately in an email that volume on its crisis line from LGBTQ+ youths seeking help increased about 125% on Election Day through midday Wednesday.\nThe president watched Harris\u2019 concession speech from the West Wing, the White House said.\nVice President Kamala Harris delivers a concession speech after the 2024 presidential election, Wednesday, Nov. 6, 2024, on the campus of Howard University in Washington.

America, she added, \u201cwill never give up the fight for our democracy.\u201d\nVice President Kamala Harris delivers a concession speech after the 2024 presidential election, Wednesday, Nov. 6, 2024, on the campus of Howard University in Washington.(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\n\nHarris urged her supporters to accept her loss in the 2024 presidential election and touted how she would help Trump with his transition.\n\u201cFolks are feeling and experiencing a range of emotions right now, I get it. But we must accept the results of this election,\u201d she said.\n\u201cEarlier today I spoke with President-elect Trump and congratulated him on his victory,\u201d Harris said to a smattering of boos from the audience. \u201cI also told him that we will help him and his team with their transition and that we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power.\u201d\nVice President Kamala Harris arrives to deliver a concession speech for the 2024 presidential election on the campus of Howard University in Washington, Wednesday, Nov. 6, 2024. (AP Photo/Ben Curtis)\n\nHarris told supporters gathered at Howard University that she had lost her race against Trump, conceding to the Republican president who is now empowered by a sweeping mandate.\n\u201cThe outcome of this election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for,\u201d Harris said. \u201cBut hear me when I say, the light of America\u2019s promise will always burn bright, as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting.\u201d\nHarris had planned to address an audience like this at Howard on election night and had hoped she would have a more upbeat message to deliver. Instead, when Harris took the stage at her alma mater, she looked out at a sea of America flags and notably forlorn faces. She was flanked by 30 American flags.\nMinnesota Gov.

Phillip)\n\nThe hype music ahead of Harris\u2019 remarks has been an eclectic mix of rap and R&B, including a nod toward what Harris would have been \u2014 America\u2019s second Black president.\nAhead of her walk on to Beyonc\u00e9's \u201cFreedom,\u201d a mix included Jeezy\u2019s \u201cMy President,\u201d which includes the lyric, \u201cMy president is Black.\u201d\nArizona\u2019s biggest county, Maricopa, says it will update its vote count this evening, sometime around 8 p.m. EST. Trump leads Harris by more than 4 points with about 60% of the expected vote counted. The newest votes will be mailed ballots that arrived or were dropped off on Election Day or shortly before. It\u2019s not clear which candidate those will favor.\nDemocrat Kamala Harris earned a statewide win in Maine, collecting a pair of electoral votes on Wednesday. Maine is one of two states that divide their electoral votes with two votes going to the statewide winner and one vote apiece to the winner of each congressional district. The last time a Republican won the statewide vote in Maine was in 1988, when Republican George W. Bush defeated Democrat Michael Dukakis. The Associated Press declared Harris the statewide winner at 4:23 p.m. EST. \nHarris\u2019 campaign chair acknowledged the Democrat\u2019s \u201cunfathomably painful\u201d loss in a memo to staff, but told the operatives who worked for the vice president that \u201cthe work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump Presidency starts now.\u201d\nJen O\u2019Malley Dillon\u2019s memo to staff acknowledged the pain of the moment for Democrats but took a hopeful tone about the work these staffers have done.\n\u201cLosing is unfathomably painful. It is hard. This will take a long time to process,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut the work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump Presidency starts now.\u201d\nO\u2019Malley Dillon said Harris \u201cisn\u2019t finished in this fight\u201d and said the staffers who worked for the vice president are \u201cgoing to be leaders in this collective mission.\u201d\n\u201cView this as the beginning, not the end\u201d she concluded. \u201cIt will be hard work. But as the boss says: hard work is good work.\u201d\nBeyonc\u00e9's \u201cFreedom\u201d became a mainstay of Harris\u2019 presidential campaign, and some of the artist\u2019s other music is providing the soundtrack of the event expected to include her concession speech.\n\u201cRun the World (Girls)\u201d played through speakers at Howard University as supporters, members of Congress and other Democratic notables awaited the Democratic nominee.\nHarris\u2019 presidential campaign took on Beyonc\u00e9's 2016 track \u201cFreedom\u201d as its anthem, with Harris walking out to it at dozens of events, including her acceptance speech at this summer\u2019s Democratic National Convention.\nThe singer appeared with Harris last month during a campaign rally in her hometown of Houston, bringing a high level of star power to what had become a key theme of the Democratic nominee\u2019s bid: freedom.\nRep.

Mayor Muriel Bowser are among the crowd waiting for Harris to speak at Howard.\nVoters in Missouri cleared the way to undo one of the nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion bans in one of seven victories for abortion rights advocates, while Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota defeated similar constitutional amendments, leaving bans in place.\nAbortion rights amendments also passed in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana. Nevada voters also approved an amendment, but they\u2019ll need to pass it again it 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.\nThe results came in the same election where Trump won the presidency. Among his inconsistent positions on abortion has been an insistence that it\u2019s an issue best left to the states. Still, the president can have a major impact on abortion policy through executive action.\n\n\n\u25b6 Read more about the national abortion landscape\nHarris has left the vice president\u2019s residence and is traveling to Howard University, her alma mater, to publicly concede the election to President-elect Trump.\nHarris has already spoken to Trump by telephone to congratulate him on winning, according to one of the VP\u2019s aides.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nThe former president and now president-elect often skipped over details but through more than a year of policy pronouncements and written statements outlined a wide-ranging agenda that blends traditional conservative approaches to taxes, regulation and cultural issues with a more populist bent on trade and a shift in America\u2019s international role.\nTrump\u2019s agenda also would scale back federal government efforts on civil rights and expand presidential powers.\n\u25b6 Read more about Trump\u2019s proposed policy plans\nBelarus\u2019 authoritarian leader President Alexander Lukashenko has congratulated Donald Trump on winning the U.S. presidential election, despite tensions between the countries.\n\u201cYou did it first and foremost in the name of America and its citizens.

See what you missed below and follow today\u2019s live updates.\nVice President Kamala Harris told supporters gathered at Howard University on Wednesday that she had lost the 2024 Election to Donald Trump, conceding to the Republican President-elect after a hard fought campaign.\nHere\u2019s what to know:\n\u25b6 Siga la cobertura de las elecciones de AP en espa\u00f1ol\nWatch live as Kamala Harris delivers her concession speech after Donald Trump was elected the 47th president of the United States.\n\nAP estimated late Wednesday evening that there are more than 200,000 ballots left to count in Nevada \u2013 including more than 130,000 in Clark County. Given the narrow margins in the races for president and U.S. Senate, both are too early to call. \nThe AP will further review results released by Nevada election officials on Thursday.\n\n\n\nOfficials in Arizona\u2019s Maricopa County said late Wednesday they\u2019ve got more than 700,000 ballots left to count, which means races for president and U.S. Senate in the state will remain too early to call for another day. \nIn all, AP estimates there are at least a million ballots to be added to the results in Arizona. County election officials are expected to firm up those numbers on Thursday.\n\n\n\nThe FBI is warning of additional fabricated videos that misuse its name and insignia to undermine confidence in the electoral system.\nOne of the videos falsely claims that the FBI was made aware that at least 301 electors reported attempted bribery and blackmail by a political party.\nAnother video falsely claims that the FBI is investigating voter pressure at US military bases overseas, a third claims that a U.S. social media company has seen an increase in the number of separatist groups to include a total audience of more than 40 million people and the fourth falsely claims that the FBI has ordered media to restrict the spread of information about the bribery of electors.\nThe FBI says each of the videos contains false information.\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has congratulated Trump on his \u201chuge win\u201d and discussed strengthening security and economic cooperation between the allies, according to a Seoul presidential official.\nKim Tae-hyo, Yoon\u2019s deputy national security director, said Thursday that Yoon and Trump also discussed the growing threats posed by nuclear-armed North Korea, including its intercontinental ballistic missiles targeting the U.S. mainland, and its reported provision of troops to Russia in support of Vladimir Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine.\nKim said Trump called for expanding the countries\u2019 cooperation in the shipbuilding industries, highlighting South Korea\u2019s strengths in building warships and vessels, and called for more detailed discussions on improving U.S. competitiveness in ship exports as well as maintenance and repair.\nKim said Yoon and Trump agreed to arrange an in-person meeting soon.\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s office said Trudeau congratulated Trump in a phone call. \u201cThe two leaders discussed the enduring and successful partnership between Canada and the United States,\u201d the statement said. \nThe statement noted that they discussed trade, supply chains, global trading practices and North American security.\nCLAIM: President Joe Biden won approximately 20 million more votes in the 2020 election than Vice President Kamala Harris earned in the 2024 race, proving either that Trump has cheated his way to a second term or that there was widespread fraud four years ago.\nTHE FACTS: The claims are unfounded. Votes from Tuesday\u2019s presidential election are still being counted, so any comparison with previous races would not be accurate. In addition, election officials and agencies monitoring the vote have reported no significant issues with Tuesday\u2019s election. Claims of widespread fraud in 2020 have been debunked countless times.\n\u25b6 Read more about the false claim\nPresident Biden will address the nation Thursday at 11 a.m. EST. The remarks to the nation will be Biden\u2019s first appearance on camera in the aftermath of Donald Trump\u2019s decisive victory over Kamala Harris.\nGolden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr spoke about the election ahead of a game against the Boston Celtics. In August, he coached the U.S. Olympics men\u2019s team to a gold medal in Paris.\n\u201cWell, I believe in democracy, and I think the American people have spoken and voted for Trump, and I want him to do well the next four years. I want our country to do well.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complex world. We\u2019ve got a lot of interesting stuff between wars abroad, a global economy that has shifted everything in terms of what it means for our citizens and their day-to-day lives,\u201d he said. \u201cI want what\u2019s best for us. I hope Trump can deliver.\u201d\nDonald Trump ran a campaign centered on hypermasculinity, actively courting young men in particular with interviews on popular male-centric podcasts.\nIn the closing weeks of the campaign, the former president and many of his surrogates leaned into sexist remarks and jokes about Vice President Kamala Harris.\nSome of his supporters, including former presidential rival Nikki Haley, warned that the former president risked exacerbating his persistent gender gap with Harris. Prominent surrogates from billionaire Elon Musk to Charlie Kirk, founder of the conservative youth organization Turning Point, called on men to vote in large numbers to counter Harris\u2019 expected strength among women.\nIn the end, the gender voting gap was unremarkable by recent historical standards.\n\u25b6 Read more takeaways from AP VoteCast\nTrump has already appointed three Supreme Court justices. In his second term, he could well have a chance to name two more, creating a high court with a Trump-appointed majority that could serve for decades.\nThe decisive outcome spares the court from having to wade into election disputes. It also seems likely to change the tenor of cases that come before the justices, including on abortion and immigration.\nThe two eldest justices \u2014 Clarence Thomas, 76, and Samuel Alito, 74 \u2014 could consider stepping down knowing that Trump, a Republican, would nominate replacements who might be three decades younger and ensure conservative domination of the court through the middle of the century, or beyond.\nRead more about how Trump could further shape the Supreme Court\nFormer President Bill Clinton and former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton wished Trump and running mate JD Vance well on Wednesday, writing that they \u201chope they will govern for all of us.\u201d\nThe Clintons had been some of the most outspoken Democratic critics of Trump. The former Democratic president stumped across the country for Harris and running mate Tim Walz, while the former secretary of state, Trump\u2019s opponent in 2016, had criticized her one-time rival throughout the entire election. The two commended Harris and Walz for running \u201ca positive, forward-looking campaign to be proud of.\u201d\n\u201cWe must remember that America is bigger than the results of any one election, and what we as citizens do now will make the difference between a nation that moves forward and one that falls back,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe need to solve our problems and see our opportunities together. The future of our country depends on it.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s campaign says he has accepted President Biden\u2019s invitation to meet at the White House to discuss the presidential transition. No date has been announced yet but Steven Cheung, Trump\u2019s communications director, said it would \u201ctake place shortly.\u201d Cheung said Trump \u201cvery much appreciated\u201d Biden\u2019s congratulatory call on Wednesday.\nBiden, in a White House-issued statement, praised Harris as \u201ca tremendous partner and public servant full of integrity, courage, and character.\u201d It was Biden\u2019s first public comment in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s victory.\nThe president also noted that Harris entered the campaign under \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d a nod to his dropping out of the race 108 days before Election Day amid growing pressure from within his party after his cataclysmic debate performance against Trump.\nBiden added that Harris \u201cstepped up and led a historic campaign that embodied what\u2019s possible when guided by a strong moral compass and a clear vision for a nation that is more free, more just, and full of more opportunities for all Americans.\u201d\nA disaffected electorate wanted former President Donald Trump to return to the White House, a blatant rejection of Vice President Kamala Harris and her nearly four years with President Joe Biden.\nThe Republican\u2019s victory came from a public so put off by America\u2019s trajectory that they welcomed his brash and disruptive approach. About 3 in 10 voters said they wanted total upheaval in how the country is run, according to AP VoteCast, a sweeping survey of more than 120,000 voters nationwide. Even if they weren\u2019t looking for something that dramatic, more than half of voters overall said they wanted to see substantial change.\n\n\nBoth nationwide and in key battleground states, the Republicans won over voters who were alarmed about the economy and prioritized more aggressive enforcement of immigration laws. Those issues largely overshadowed many voters\u2019 focus on the future of democracy and abortion protections \u2014 key priorities for Harris\u2019 voters, but not enough to turn the election in her favor.\n\u25b6 Learn how this key issue shaped the election\nMinnesota Gov.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nAs Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz was leaving after his running mate\u2019s concession speech, a reporter asked him: \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d\n\u201cMinnesota,\u201d he answered.\nMelania Trump marked her husband\u2019s win in the 2025 election by saying a \u201cmajority of Americans have entrusted us with this important responsibility.\u201d\nThe former \u2014 and future \u2014 first lady was an infrequent figure on the campaign trail with the Republican candidate. Melania Trump attended but did not speak at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. She did appear at Donald Trump\u2019s election party early on Wednesday morning.\n\u201cWe will safeguard the heart of our republic \u2013 freedom,\u201d Melania Trump wrote. \u201cI anticipate the citizens of our nation rejoining in commitment to each other and rising above ideology for the sake of individual liberty, economic prosperity, and security.\u201d\nFor all the concerns about a tumultuous process that could leave Americans waiting for days to learn who its next president would be, news outlets instead experienced an election night that hewed close to tradition.\nFox News Channel declared Trump had reclaimed the presidency at 1:47 a.m. on Wednesday. Broadcast networks and The Associated Press had Trump on the precipice of returning to the presidency when he took the stage in Florida at 2:25 a.m. to declare victory.\nMany journalists warned viewers that determining the winner could be a protracted process that could take several days like it had in 2020.\nYet from the first hints provided by exit poll results shortly after 5 p.m. EST, the election night story moved methodically in Trump\u2019s direction.\n\u25b6 Read more about how the media covered election night\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement late Wednesday, saying that \u201cwe all pray for America\u2019s success under the next administration,\u201d but did not make mention of Trump by name.\nPelosi was seen as the architect of the Democratic party\u2019s strategic shift from Joe Biden to Kamala Harris as top of their ticket over the summer. The California Democrat has been Trump\u2019s biggest critic, saying previously that her goal is to ensure Trump never enters the White House again.\n\u201cThe peaceful transfer of power is the cornerstone of our democracy,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cAfter every election, we all have a responsibility to come together and find common ground.\u201d\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence congratulated Trump for winning a second term in office, writing yet another awkward chapter in the relationship between the president-elect and his former running mate.\n\u201cThe American people have spoken and Karen and I send our sincere congratulations to President-Elect Donald Trump and his family on his election as 47th President of the United States,\u201d Pence wrote on behalf of him and his wife. The former vice president also congratulated Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who ran in place of Pence as Trump\u2019s running mate.\n\u201cWe will continue to pray for all those in authority and urge every American to join us in praying for our incoming President, Vice President and elected officials at every level,\u201d Pence concluded.\nPence\u2019s relationship with Trump fractured after the former vice president declined to follow the Republican president\u2019s wishes and went ahead with certifying the 2020 election. Trump did not hold back in his contempt for Pence, questioning his judgment and calling him \u201cdelusional\u201d on the campaign trail. Pence, in turn, declined to endorse his one-time running mate.\nRepublican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump arrives at an election night watch party at the Palm Beach Convention Center, Wednesday, Nov. 6, 2024, in West Palm Beach, Fla. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nAmerican presidential elections are a moment when the nation holds up a mirror to look at itself. They are a reflection of values and dreams, of grievances and scores to be settled.\nThe results say much about a country\u2019s character, future and core beliefs. On Tuesday, America looked into that mirror and more voters saw former president Donald Trump, delivering him a far-reaching victory in the most contested states.\nHe won for many reasons. One of them was that a formidable number of Americans, from different angles, said the state of democracy was a prime concern.\nEven as Trump prevailed, most voters said they were very or somewhat concerned that electing Trump would bring the U.S. closer to being an authoritarian country, where a single leader has unchecked power, according to the AP VoteCast survey. Still, 1 in 10 of those voters backed him anyway. Nearly 4 in 10 Trump voters said they wanted complete upheaval in how the country is run.\n\u25b6 Read more about Trump\u2019s plans for American democracy\nThey\u2019re called swing states for a reason.\nOn Tuesday, Trump led the Republican ticket to a sweeping national victory. He was on track to improve upon his 2020 vote performance in 48 states. This included bringing back into the fold the five states that had abandoned him for Democratic Joe Biden four years ago.\n\n\nSix of the seven 2024 presidential battlegrounds that helped decide Tuesday\u2019s election had all moved sharply away from Trump in 2020. They included Georgia and Arizona, which hadn\u2019t supported a Democrat for president in more than 20 years, as well as North Carolina, which shifted sharply to the left but barely remained in Trump\u2019s column in 2020.\nPennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin all supported Trump in 2016 after supporting Democratic presidential candidates for at least six consecutive elections but swung back toward Democrats in 2020.\n\n\nThis year, Trump significantly outperformed his 2020 showing in all battlegrounds and had either won or was leading in the vote in the count as of Wednesday afternoon.\nNevada maintained a 2.4 percentage-point advantage for the Democratic candidate in both 2016 and 2020. But Trump led by almost 5 percentage points on Wednesday, although the AP had not yet called the race.\nThe election of Donald Trump as president for a second time and the Republican takeback of the U.S. Senate could undo many of the national climate policies that are most reducing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to climate solutions experts.\nWhen they list measures that are making the most difference, it lines up with policies Trump has said he\u2019ll target.\nThese rollbacks will come as more lives are being lost in heat waves, record amounts of climate pollution are accumulating in the atmosphere, the United States has been hit with what may be two of its most expensive hurricanes, and nations, which will meet in Baku, Azerbaijan next week for climate negotiations, have failed to take strong action to change these realities.\n\u25b6 Read about some of the measures\nIn a statement issued Wednesday, former President Barack Obama, along with former first lady Michelle Obama, said the election\u2019s result \u201cis obviously not the outcome we had hoped for\u201d but noted that \u201cliving in a democracy is about recognizing that our point of view won\u2019t always win out, and being willing to accept the peaceful transfer of power.\u201d\nCongratulating Trump and Vance, the Obamas expressed pride for Harris and Walz, for both of whom they campaigned, calling them \u201ctwo extraordinary public servants who ran a remarkable campaign.\u201d\nThe Obamas cast forward with hope for a divided America, saying that the nation\u2019s problems are solvable \u201conly if we listen to each other, and only if we abide by the core constitutional principles and democratic norms that made this country great.\u201d\nThe White House is encouraging Trump to enter into the required agreements necessary to begin an orderly presidential transition.\nTrump\u2019s transition team still has not signed the agreements with the White House and the General Services Administration that allow them access to federal facilities, documents and personnel. The delay is holding up the federal government\u2019s ability to begin processing security clearances for potential Trump administration national security appointees, potentially limiting the number of his staff who could work on sensitive information by Inauguration Day.\nWhite House chief of staff Jeff Zients reached out to co-chairs Howard Lutnick and Linda McMahon to reiterate the role the agreements play in beginning a presidential transition, according to a White House official. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive transition planning.\nShortly after Harris\u2019 concession speech, a series of Democratic lawmakers issued their first statements in response to the election results and promised to ensure a \u201cpeaceful\u201d transition for the incoming Republican administration.\n\u201cAs deeply, deeply disappointed as I am by the results of the election, make no mistake: my Democratic colleagues and I \u2014 unlike many Republicans after the 2020 election \u2014 will uphold the will of the American people, fulfill our constitutional duty and do our part to ensure a peaceful transfer of power,\u201d Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois said in a statement.\nTransition talks have not yet begun in earnest, according to a person with knowledge of the Trump campaign. Instead, the president-elect was busy taking calls from leaders, domestic and international, donors and key supporters. Transition discussions are expected to ramp up later in the week, as attention turns to naming an inaugural committee and formal transition team. The person was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\nNevada resumed counting votes on Wednesday afternoon, adding almost 21,000 votes including 9,000 from Clark County. Trump\u2019s lead in the state is about 560,000 votes, and the race is too early to call. Clark, home to Las Vegas, has the greatest number of ballots left to be counted. Election officials in Clark plan for another update late Wednesday and to update daily at 11 p.m. EST through Saturday.\nVice President Kamala Harris delivers a concession speech for the 2024 presidential election, Wednesday, Nov. 6, 2024, on the campus of Howard University in Washington.

And, you know, the establishment produced a disaster.\u201d\n\u25b6 Read more about the Democrats\u2019 future\nFormer President Donald Trump won Alaska and its three electoral votes on Wednesday, adding to his lead in the Electoral College. Trump continues a decadeslong trend of Republicans carrying the state in the presidential race. When discussing Alaska, he has often cited his role while president in the passage of a 2017 tax law that called for oil and gas leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Trump endorsed in Alaska\u2019s other high-profile race this election cycle, backing Republican Nick Begich for U.S. House. The Associated Press declared Trump the winner at 4:59 p.m. EST.\nMore than 70 national, state and local LGBTQ+ rights and advocacy organizations released a \u201csolidarity statement\u201d Wednesday reacting to the results of this week\u2019s elections.\n\u201cElection outcomes at national, state, and local levels will impact our health, our safety, and our rights as LGBTQIA2S+ people and families,\u201d the statement read. \u201cDespite anti-LGBTQIA2S+ efforts to divide our communities, and particularly severe attacks against transgender people and LGBTQIA2S+ youth, we have succeeded in moving a few steps closer toward equity and justice for our community.\u201d\nThe letter highlighted the reelection of lesbian U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and the election of the first transgender member of Congress, Rep.-elect Sarah McBride, of Delaware.\nThe statement did not mention Trump by name. But he and other Republican candidates frequently employed anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric in campaign ads, remarks and platforms, particularly against transgender and nonbinary people.\nThe statement was signed by groups including the National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, GLAAD, many PFLAG and Equality chapters, the Transgender Law Center, Advocates for Trans Equality, and the Trevor Project, a youth suicide prevention organization.\nJaymes Black, CEO of the Trevor Project, said separately in an email that volume on its crisis line from LGBTQ+ youths seeking help increased about 125% on Election Day through midday Wednesday.\nThe president watched Harris\u2019 concession speech from the West Wing, the White House said.\nVice President Kamala Harris delivers a concession speech after the 2024 presidential election, Wednesday, Nov. 6, 2024, on the campus of Howard University in Washington.

That doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t win.

Trump leads Harris by more than 4 points with about 60% of the expected vote counted. The newest votes will be mailed ballots that arrived or were dropped off on Election Day or shortly before. It\u2019s not clear which candidate those will favor.\nDemocrat Kamala Harris earned a statewide win in Maine, collecting a pair of electoral votes on Wednesday. Maine is one of two states that divide their electoral votes with two votes going to the statewide winner and one vote apiece to the winner of each congressional district. The last time a Republican won the statewide vote in Maine was in 1988, when Republican George W. Bush defeated Democrat Michael Dukakis. The Associated Press declared Harris the statewide winner at 4:23 p.m. EST. \nHarris\u2019 campaign chair acknowledged the Democrat\u2019s \u201cunfathomably painful\u201d loss in a memo to staff, but told the operatives who worked for the vice president that \u201cthe work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump Presidency starts now.\u201d\nJen O\u2019Malley Dillon\u2019s memo to staff acknowledged the pain of the moment for Democrats but took a hopeful tone about the work these staffers have done.\n\u201cLosing is unfathomably painful. It is hard. This will take a long time to process,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut the work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump Presidency starts now.\u201d\nO\u2019Malley Dillon said Harris \u201cisn\u2019t finished in this fight\u201d and said the staffers who worked for the vice president are \u201cgoing to be leaders in this collective mission.\u201d\n\u201cView this as the beginning, not the end\u201d she concluded. \u201cIt will be hard work.

Mayor Muriel Bowser are among the crowd waiting for Harris to speak at Howard.\nVoters in Missouri cleared the way to undo one of the nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion bans in one of seven victories for abortion rights advocates, while Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota defeated similar constitutional amendments, leaving bans in place.\nAbortion rights amendments also passed in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana. Nevada voters also approved an amendment, but they\u2019ll need to pass it again it 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.\nThe results came in the same election where Trump won the presidency. Among his inconsistent positions on abortion has been an insistence that it\u2019s an issue best left to the states. Still, the president can have a major impact on abortion policy through executive action.\n\n\n\u25b6 Read more about the national abortion landscape\nHarris has left the vice president\u2019s residence and is traveling to Howard University, her alma mater, to publicly concede the election to President-elect Trump.\nHarris has already spoken to Trump by telephone to congratulate him on winning, according to one of the VP\u2019s aides.

He won Michigan on Wednesday afternoon, sweeping the \u201cblue wall\u201d along with Pennsylvania \u2014 the one-time Democrat-leaning, swing states that all went for Trump in 2016 before flipping to President Joe Biden in 2020.\nHis Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, called Trump on Wednesday afternoon to concede the race and congratulate him. A short time later, Biden also called Trump to congratulate him and to invite the president-elect to the White House, formally kicking off the transition ahead of Inauguration Day, the White House said. Biden also called Harris.\nForeign leaders called Trump too, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and French President Emmanuel Macron.\nThe victory validates Trump\u2019s bare-knuckles approach to politics. He had attacked Harris in deeply personal \u2013 often misogynistic and racist \u2013 terms as he pushed an apocalyptic picture of a country overrun by violent migrants. The coarse rhetoric, paired with an image of hypermasculinity, resonated with angry voters \u2013 particularly men \u2013 in a deeply polarized nation. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cI want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honor of being elected your 47th president and your 45th president,\u201d Trump told throngs of cheering supporters in Florida even before his victory was confirmed.\nIn state after state, Trump outperformed what he did in the 2020 election while Harris failed to do as well as Joe Biden did in winning the presidency four years ago. Upon taking office again, Trump will work with a Senate that will now be in Republican hands, while control of the House hadn\u2019t been determined.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been through so much together, and today you showed up in record numbers to deliver a victory,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis was something special and we\u2019re going to pay you back,\u201d he said. \nThe U.S. stock market, Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla, banks and bitcoin all stormed higher Wednesday, as investors looked favorably on a smooth election and Trump returning to the White House. In his second term, Trump has vowed to pursue an agenda centered on dramatically reshaping the federal government and pursuing retribution against his perceived enemies. \nThe results cap a historically tumultuous and competitive election season that included two assassination attempts targeting Trump and a shift to a new Democratic nominee just a month before the party\u2019s convention. Trump will inherit a range of challenges when he assumes office on Jan. 20, including heightened political polarization and global crises that are testing America\u2019s influence abroad.\nHis win against Harris, the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket, marks the second time he has defeated a female rival in a general election. Harris, the current vice president, rose to the top of the ticket after Biden exited the race amid alarm about his advanced age. Despite an initial surge of energy around her campaign, she struggled during a compressed timeline to convince disillusioned voters that she represented a break from an unpopular administration.\nThe vice president, who has not appeared publicly since the race was called, was set to speak Wednesday afternoon at Howard University, where her supporters gathered Tuesday night for a watch party while the results were still in doubt.\nWhat to know about the 2024 election:\nNews outlets globally count on the AP for accurate U.S. election results. Since 1848, the AP has been calling races up and down the ballot. Support us. Donate to the AP.\nTrump is the first former president to return to power since Grover Cleveland regained the White House in the 1892 election. He is the first person convicted of a felony to be elected president and, at 78, is the oldest person elected to the office. His vice president, 40-year-old Ohio Sen. JD Vance, will become the highest-ranking member of the millennial generation in the U.S. government.\nThere will be far fewer checks on Trump when he returns to the White House. He has plans to swiftly enact a sweeping agenda that would transform nearly every aspect of American government. His GOP critics in Congress have largely been defeated or retired. Federal courts are now filled with judges he appointed. The U.S. Supreme Court, which includes three Trump-appointed justices, issued a ruling this year affording presidents broad immunity from prosecution.\nTrump\u2019s language and behavior during the campaign sparked growing warnings from Democrats and some Republicans about shocks to democracy that his return to power would bring. He repeatedly praised strongman leaders, warned that he would deploy the military to target political opponents he labeled the \u201cenemy from within,\u201d threatened to take action against news organizations for unfavorable coverage and suggested suspending the Constitution.\nSome who served in his White House, including Vice President Mike Pence and John Kelly, Trump\u2019s longest-serving chief of staff, either declined to endorse him or issued dire public warnings about his return.\nWhile Harris focused much of her initial message around themes of joy, Trump channeled a powerful sense of anger and resentment among voters. \nHe seized on frustrations over high prices and fears about crime and migrants who illegally entered the country on Biden\u2019s watch. He also highlighted wars in the Middle East and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine to cast Democrats as presiding over \u2013 and encouraging \u2013 a world in chaos.\nIt was a formula Trump perfected in 2016, when he cast himself as the only person who could fix the country\u2019s problems, often borrowing language from dictators.\n\u201cIn 2016, I declared I am your voice. Today I add: I am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution,\u201d he said in March 2023.\nThis campaign often veered into the absurd, with Trump amplifying bizarre and disproven rumors that migrants were stealing and eating pet cats and dogs in an Ohio town. At one point, he kicked off a rally with a detailed story about the legendary golfer Arnold Palmer in which he praised his genitalia.\nOne defining moment came in July when a gunman opened fire at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. A bullet grazed Trump\u2019s ear and killed a supporter. His face streaked with blood, Trump stood and raised his fist in the air, shouting \u201cFight! Fight! Fight!\u201d Weeks later, a second assassination attempt was thwarted after a Secret Service agent spotted the barrel of a gun poking through the greenery while Trump was playing golf.\nTrump\u2019s return to the White House seemed unlikely when he left Washington in early 2021 as a diminished figure whose lies about his defeat sparked a violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. He was so isolated then that few outside of his family bothered to attend the send-off he organized for himself at Andrews Air Force Base, complete with a 21-gun salute.\nDemocrats who controlled the U.S. House quickly impeached him for his role in the insurrection, making him the only president to be impeached twice. He was acquitted by the Senate, where many Republicans argued that he no longer posed a threat because he had left office.\nBut from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump \u2013 aided by some elected Republicans \u2013 worked to maintain his political relevance. Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the California Republican who then led his party in the U.S. House, visited Trump soon after he left office, essentially validating his continued role in the party.\nAs the 2022 midterm election approached, Trump used the power of his endorsement to assert himself as the unquestioned leader of the party. His preferred candidates almost always won their primaries, but some went on to defeat in elections that Republicans viewed as within their grasp. Those disappointing results were driven in part by a backlash to the Supreme Court ruling that revoked a woman\u2019s constitutional right to an abortion, a decision aided by Trump-appointed justices. The midterm election prompted questions within the GOP about whether Trump should remain the party\u2019s leader.\nBut if Trump\u2019s future was in doubt, that changed in 2023 when he faced a wave of state and federal indictments for his role in the insurrection, his handling of classified information and election interference. He used the charges to portray himself as the victim of an overreaching government, an argument that resonated with a GOP base that was increasingly skeptical \u2013 if not outright hostile \u2013 to institutions and established power structures.\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith was evaluating Wednesday how to wind down the two federal criminal cases against Trump.\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who challenged Trump for the Republican nomination, lamented that the indictments \u201csucked out all the oxygen\u201d from the GOP primary. Trump easily captured his party\u2019s nomination without participating in a debate against DeSantis or other GOP candidates.\nWith Trump dominating the Republican contest, a New York jury found him guilty in May of 34 felony charges in a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election through a hush money payment to a porn actor who said the two had sex. He faces sentencing this month, though his victory poses serious questions about whether he will ever face punishment.\nHe also has been found liable in two other New York civil cases: one for inflating his assets and another for sexually abusing advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in 1996. \nTrump is subject to additional criminal charges in an election-interference case in Georgia that has become bogged down. On the federal level, he\u2019s been indicted for his role in trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election and improperly handling classified material. When he becomes president, Trump could appoint an attorney general who would erase the federal charges. \nAs he prepares to return to the White House, Trump has vowed to swiftly enact a radical agenda that would transform nearly every aspect of American government. That includes plans to launch the largest deportation effort in the nation\u2019s history, to use the Justice Department to punish his enemies, to dramatically expand the use of tariffs and to again pursue a zero-sum approach to foreign policy that threatens to upend longstanding foreign alliances, including the NATO pact.\nWhen he arrived in Washington 2017, Trump knew little about the levers of federal power. His agenda was stymied by Congress and the courts, as well as senior staff members who took it upon themselves to serve as guardrails. \nThis time, Trump has said he would surround himself with loyalists who will enact his agenda, no questions asked, and who will arrive with hundreds of draft executive orders, legislative proposals and in-depth policy papers in hand. \n___\nColvin reported from West Palm Beach, Florida. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

County election officials are expected to firm up those numbers on Thursday.\n\n\n\nThe FBI is warning of additional fabricated videos that misuse its name and insignia to undermine confidence in the electoral system.\nOne of the videos falsely claims that the FBI was made aware that at least 301 electors reported attempted bribery and blackmail by a political party.\nAnother video falsely claims that the FBI is investigating voter pressure at US military bases overseas, a third claims that a U.S. social media company has seen an increase in the number of separatist groups to include a total audience of more than 40 million people and the fourth falsely claims that the FBI has ordered media to restrict the spread of information about the bribery of electors.\nThe FBI says each of the videos contains false information.\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has congratulated Trump on his \u201chuge win\u201d and discussed strengthening security and economic cooperation between the allies, according to a Seoul presidential official.\nKim Tae-hyo, Yoon\u2019s deputy national security director, said Thursday that Yoon and Trump also discussed the growing threats posed by nuclear-armed North Korea, including its intercontinental ballistic missiles targeting the U.S. mainland, and its reported provision of troops to Russia in support of Vladimir Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine.\nKim said Trump called for expanding the countries\u2019 cooperation in the shipbuilding industries, highlighting South Korea\u2019s strengths in building warships and vessels, and called for more detailed discussions on improving U.S. competitiveness in ship exports as well as maintenance and repair.\nKim said Yoon and Trump agreed to arrange an in-person meeting soon.\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s office said Trudeau congratulated Trump in a phone call. \u201cThe two leaders discussed the enduring and successful partnership between Canada and the United States,\u201d the statement said. \nThe statement noted that they discussed trade, supply chains, global trading practices and North American security.\nCLAIM: President Joe Biden won approximately 20 million more votes in the 2020 election than Vice President Kamala Harris earned in the 2024 race, proving either that Trump has cheated his way to a second term or that there was widespread fraud four years ago.\nTHE FACTS: The claims are unfounded. Votes from Tuesday\u2019s presidential election are still being counted, so any comparison with previous races would not be accurate. In addition, election officials and agencies monitoring the vote have reported no significant issues with Tuesday\u2019s election. Claims of widespread fraud in 2020 have been debunked countless times.\n\u25b6 Read more about the false claim\nPresident Biden will address the nation Thursday at 11 a.m. EST. The remarks to the nation will be Biden\u2019s first appearance on camera in the aftermath of Donald Trump\u2019s decisive victory over Kamala Harris.\nGolden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr spoke about the election ahead of a game against the Boston Celtics. In August, he coached the U.S. Olympics men\u2019s team to a gold medal in Paris.\n\u201cWell, I believe in democracy, and I think the American people have spoken and voted for Trump, and I want him to do well the next four years. I want our country to do well.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complex world. We\u2019ve got a lot of interesting stuff between wars abroad, a global economy that has shifted everything in terms of what it means for our citizens and their day-to-day lives,\u201d he said. \u201cI want what\u2019s best for us. I hope Trump can deliver.\u201d\nDonald Trump ran a campaign centered on hypermasculinity, actively courting young men in particular with interviews on popular male-centric podcasts.\nIn the closing weeks of the campaign, the former president and many of his surrogates leaned into sexist remarks and jokes about Vice President Kamala Harris.\nSome of his supporters, including former presidential rival Nikki Haley, warned that the former president risked exacerbating his persistent gender gap with Harris. Prominent surrogates from billionaire Elon Musk to Charlie Kirk, founder of the conservative youth organization Turning Point, called on men to vote in large numbers to counter Harris\u2019 expected strength among women.\nIn the end, the gender voting gap was unremarkable by recent historical standards.\n\u25b6 Read more takeaways from AP VoteCast\nTrump has already appointed three Supreme Court justices. In his second term, he could well have a chance to name two more, creating a high court with a Trump-appointed majority that could serve for decades.\nThe decisive outcome spares the court from having to wade into election disputes. It also seems likely to change the tenor of cases that come before the justices, including on abortion and immigration.\nThe two eldest justices \u2014 Clarence Thomas, 76, and Samuel Alito, 74 \u2014 could consider stepping down knowing that Trump, a Republican, would nominate replacements who might be three decades younger and ensure conservative domination of the court through the middle of the century, or beyond.\nRead more about how Trump could further shape the Supreme Court\nFormer President Bill Clinton and former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton wished Trump and running mate JD Vance well on Wednesday, writing that they \u201chope they will govern for all of us.\u201d\nThe Clintons had been some of the most outspoken Democratic critics of Trump. The former Democratic president stumped across the country for Harris and running mate Tim Walz, while the former secretary of state, Trump\u2019s opponent in 2016, had criticized her one-time rival throughout the entire election. The two commended Harris and Walz for running \u201ca positive, forward-looking campaign to be proud of.\u201d\n\u201cWe must remember that America is bigger than the results of any one election, and what we as citizens do now will make the difference between a nation that moves forward and one that falls back,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe need to solve our problems and see our opportunities together. The future of our country depends on it.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s campaign says he has accepted President Biden\u2019s invitation to meet at the White House to discuss the presidential transition. No date has been announced yet but Steven Cheung, Trump\u2019s communications director, said it would \u201ctake place shortly.\u201d Cheung said Trump \u201cvery much appreciated\u201d Biden\u2019s congratulatory call on Wednesday.\nBiden, in a White House-issued statement, praised Harris as \u201ca tremendous partner and public servant full of integrity, courage, and character.\u201d It was Biden\u2019s first public comment in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s victory.\nThe president also noted that Harris entered the campaign under \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d a nod to his dropping out of the race 108 days before Election Day amid growing pressure from within his party after his cataclysmic debate performance against Trump.\nBiden added that Harris \u201cstepped up and led a historic campaign that embodied what\u2019s possible when guided by a strong moral compass and a clear vision for a nation that is more free, more just, and full of more opportunities for all Americans.\u201d\nA disaffected electorate wanted former President Donald Trump to return to the White House, a blatant rejection of Vice President Kamala Harris and her nearly four years with President Joe Biden.\nThe Republican\u2019s victory came from a public so put off by America\u2019s trajectory that they welcomed his brash and disruptive approach. About 3 in 10 voters said they wanted total upheaval in how the country is run, according to AP VoteCast, a sweeping survey of more than 120,000 voters nationwide. Even if they weren\u2019t looking for something that dramatic, more than half of voters overall said they wanted to see substantial change.\n\n\nBoth nationwide and in key battleground states, the Republicans won over voters who were alarmed about the economy and prioritized more aggressive enforcement of immigration laws. Those issues largely overshadowed many voters\u2019 focus on the future of democracy and abortion protections \u2014 key priorities for Harris\u2019 voters, but not enough to turn the election in her favor.\n\u25b6 Learn how this key issue shaped the election\nMinnesota Gov.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nAs Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz was leaving after his running mate\u2019s concession speech, a reporter asked him: \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d\n\u201cMinnesota,\u201d he answered.\nMelania Trump marked her husband\u2019s win in the 2025 election by saying a \u201cmajority of Americans have entrusted us with this important responsibility.\u201d\nThe former \u2014 and future \u2014 first lady was an infrequent figure on the campaign trail with the Republican candidate. Melania Trump attended but did not speak at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. She did appear at Donald Trump\u2019s election party early on Wednesday morning.\n\u201cWe will safeguard the heart of our republic \u2013 freedom,\u201d Melania Trump wrote. \u201cI anticipate the citizens of our nation rejoining in commitment to each other and rising above ideology for the sake of individual liberty, economic prosperity, and security.\u201d\nFor all the concerns about a tumultuous process that could leave Americans waiting for days to learn who its next president would be, news outlets instead experienced an election night that hewed close to tradition.\nFox News Channel declared Trump had reclaimed the presidency at 1:47 a.m. on Wednesday. Broadcast networks and The Associated Press had Trump on the precipice of returning to the presidency when he took the stage in Florida at 2:25 a.m. to declare victory.\nMany journalists warned viewers that determining the winner could be a protracted process that could take several days like it had in 2020.\nYet from the first hints provided by exit poll results shortly after 5 p.m. EST, the election night story moved methodically in Trump\u2019s direction.\n\u25b6 Read more about how the media covered election night\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement late Wednesday, saying that \u201cwe all pray for America\u2019s success under the next administration,\u201d but did not make mention of Trump by name.\nPelosi was seen as the architect of the Democratic party\u2019s strategic shift from Joe Biden to Kamala Harris as top of their ticket over the summer. The California Democrat has been Trump\u2019s biggest critic, saying previously that her goal is to ensure Trump never enters the White House again.\n\u201cThe peaceful transfer of power is the cornerstone of our democracy,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cAfter every election, we all have a responsibility to come together and find common ground.\u201d\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence congratulated Trump for winning a second term in office, writing yet another awkward chapter in the relationship between the president-elect and his former running mate.\n\u201cThe American people have spoken and Karen and I send our sincere congratulations to President-Elect Donald Trump and his family on his election as 47th President of the United States,\u201d Pence wrote on behalf of him and his wife. The former vice president also congratulated Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who ran in place of Pence as Trump\u2019s running mate.\n\u201cWe will continue to pray for all those in authority and urge every American to join us in praying for our incoming President, Vice President and elected officials at every level,\u201d Pence concluded.\nPence\u2019s relationship with Trump fractured after the former vice president declined to follow the Republican president\u2019s wishes and went ahead with certifying the 2020 election. Trump did not hold back in his contempt for Pence, questioning his judgment and calling him \u201cdelusional\u201d on the campaign trail. Pence, in turn, declined to endorse his one-time running mate.\nRepublican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump arrives at an election night watch party at the Palm Beach Convention Center, Wednesday, Nov. 6, 2024, in West Palm Beach, Fla. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nAmerican presidential elections are a moment when the nation holds up a mirror to look at itself. They are a reflection of values and dreams, of grievances and scores to be settled.\nThe results say much about a country\u2019s character, future and core beliefs. On Tuesday, America looked into that mirror and more voters saw former president Donald Trump, delivering him a far-reaching victory in the most contested states.\nHe won for many reasons. One of them was that a formidable number of Americans, from different angles, said the state of democracy was a prime concern.\nEven as Trump prevailed, most voters said they were very or somewhat concerned that electing Trump would bring the U.S. closer to being an authoritarian country, where a single leader has unchecked power, according to the AP VoteCast survey. Still, 1 in 10 of those voters backed him anyway. Nearly 4 in 10 Trump voters said they wanted complete upheaval in how the country is run.\n\u25b6 Read more about Trump\u2019s plans for American democracy\nThey\u2019re called swing states for a reason.\nOn Tuesday, Trump led the Republican ticket to a sweeping national victory. He was on track to improve upon his 2020 vote performance in 48 states. This included bringing back into the fold the five states that had abandoned him for Democratic Joe Biden four years ago.\n\n\nSix of the seven 2024 presidential battlegrounds that helped decide Tuesday\u2019s election had all moved sharply away from Trump in 2020. They included Georgia and Arizona, which hadn\u2019t supported a Democrat for president in more than 20 years, as well as North Carolina, which shifted sharply to the left but barely remained in Trump\u2019s column in 2020.\nPennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin all supported Trump in 2016 after supporting Democratic presidential candidates for at least six consecutive elections but swung back toward Democrats in 2020.\n\n\nThis year, Trump significantly outperformed his 2020 showing in all battlegrounds and had either won or was leading in the vote in the count as of Wednesday afternoon.\nNevada maintained a 2.4 percentage-point advantage for the Democratic candidate in both 2016 and 2020. But Trump led by almost 5 percentage points on Wednesday, although the AP had not yet called the race.\nThe election of Donald Trump as president for a second time and the Republican takeback of the U.S. Senate could undo many of the national climate policies that are most reducing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to climate solutions experts.\nWhen they list measures that are making the most difference, it lines up with policies Trump has said he\u2019ll target.\nThese rollbacks will come as more lives are being lost in heat waves, record amounts of climate pollution are accumulating in the atmosphere, the United States has been hit with what may be two of its most expensive hurricanes, and nations, which will meet in Baku, Azerbaijan next week for climate negotiations, have failed to take strong action to change these realities.\n\u25b6 Read about some of the measures\nIn a statement issued Wednesday, former President Barack Obama, along with former first lady Michelle Obama, said the election\u2019s result \u201cis obviously not the outcome we had hoped for\u201d but noted that \u201cliving in a democracy is about recognizing that our point of view won\u2019t always win out, and being willing to accept the peaceful transfer of power.\u201d\nCongratulating Trump and Vance, the Obamas expressed pride for Harris and Walz, for both of whom they campaigned, calling them \u201ctwo extraordinary public servants who ran a remarkable campaign.\u201d\nThe Obamas cast forward with hope for a divided America, saying that the nation\u2019s problems are solvable \u201conly if we listen to each other, and only if we abide by the core constitutional principles and democratic norms that made this country great.\u201d\nThe White House is encouraging Trump to enter into the required agreements necessary to begin an orderly presidential transition.\nTrump\u2019s transition team still has not signed the agreements with the White House and the General Services Administration that allow them access to federal facilities, documents and personnel. The delay is holding up the federal government\u2019s ability to begin processing security clearances for potential Trump administration national security appointees, potentially limiting the number of his staff who could work on sensitive information by Inauguration Day.\nWhite House chief of staff Jeff Zients reached out to co-chairs Howard Lutnick and Linda McMahon to reiterate the role the agreements play in beginning a presidential transition, according to a White House official. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive transition planning.\nShortly after Harris\u2019 concession speech, a series of Democratic lawmakers issued their first statements in response to the election results and promised to ensure a \u201cpeaceful\u201d transition for the incoming Republican administration.\n\u201cAs deeply, deeply disappointed as I am by the results of the election, make no mistake: my Democratic colleagues and I \u2014 unlike many Republicans after the 2020 election \u2014 will uphold the will of the American people, fulfill our constitutional duty and do our part to ensure a peaceful transfer of power,\u201d Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois said in a statement.\nTransition talks have not yet begun in earnest, according to a person with knowledge of the Trump campaign. Instead, the president-elect was busy taking calls from leaders, domestic and international, donors and key supporters. Transition discussions are expected to ramp up later in the week, as attention turns to naming an inaugural committee and formal transition team. The person was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\nNevada resumed counting votes on Wednesday afternoon, adding almost 21,000 votes including 9,000 from Clark County. Trump\u2019s lead in the state is about 560,000 votes, and the race is too early to call. Clark, home to Las Vegas, has the greatest number of ballots left to be counted. Election officials in Clark plan for another update late Wednesday and to update daily at 11 p.m. EST through Saturday.\nVice President Kamala Harris delivers a concession speech for the 2024 presidential election, Wednesday, Nov. 6, 2024, on the campus of Howard University in Washington.

Trump continues a decadeslong trend of Republicans carrying the state in the presidential race. When discussing Alaska, he has often cited his role while president in the passage of a 2017 tax law that called for oil and gas leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Trump endorsed in Alaska\u2019s other high-profile race this election cycle, backing Republican Nick Begich for U.S. House. The Associated Press declared Trump the winner at 4:59 p.m. EST.\nMore than 70 national, state and local LGBTQ+ rights and advocacy organizations released a \u201csolidarity statement\u201d Wednesday reacting to the results of this week\u2019s elections.\n\u201cElection outcomes at national, state, and local levels will impact our health, our safety, and our rights as LGBTQIA2S+ people and families,\u201d the statement read. \u201cDespite anti-LGBTQIA2S+ efforts to divide our communities, and particularly severe attacks against transgender people and LGBTQIA2S+ youth, we have succeeded in moving a few steps closer toward equity and justice for our community.\u201d\nThe letter highlighted the reelection of lesbian U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and the election of the first transgender member of Congress, Rep.-elect Sarah McBride, of Delaware.\nThe statement did not mention Trump by name. But he and other Republican candidates frequently employed anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric in campaign ads, remarks and platforms, particularly against transgender and nonbinary people.\nThe statement was signed by groups including the National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, GLAAD, many PFLAG and Equality chapters, the Transgender Law Center, Advocates for Trans Equality, and the Trevor Project, a youth suicide prevention organization.\nJaymes Black, CEO of the Trevor Project, said separately in an email that volume on its crisis line from LGBTQ+ youths seeking help increased about 125% on Election Day through midday Wednesday.\nThe president watched Harris\u2019 concession speech from the West Wing, the White House said.\nVice President Kamala Harris delivers a concession speech after the 2024 presidential election, Wednesday, Nov. 6, 2024, on the campus of Howard University in Washington.

Maine is one of two states that divide their electoral votes with two votes going to the statewide winner and one vote apiece to the winner of each congressional district. The last time a Republican won the statewide vote in Maine was in 1988, when Republican George W. Bush defeated Democrat Michael Dukakis.

My heart is full today, full of gratitude for the trust you have placed in me, full of love for our country, and full of resolve,\" Harris said. \"The outcome of this election was not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for, but hear me when I say the light of America's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting.\"\nThe vice president expressed gratitude to her family, President Biden, first lady Dr. Jill Biden, her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and her campaign staff. Mr. Biden watched the remarks from the West Wing, the White House said.\n\"I am so proud of the race we ran and the way we ran it. Over the 107 days of this campaign, we have been intentional about building community and building coalitions, bringing people together from every walk of life and background, united by love of country with enthusiasm and joy in our fight for America's future,\" Harris said. And we did it with the knowledge that we all have so much more in common than what separates us.\"\nHarris said the results of the election must be accepted and reiterated that she had spoken with Trump and is committed to a peaceful transfer of power.\n\"A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results,\" she said. \"That principle as much as any other distinguishes democracy from monarchy and tyranny, and anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it.\"\nHarris said the nation does not owe loyalty to a president or party, but to the Constitution, \"our conscience and to our God.\"\u00a0\n\"My allegiance to all three is why I am here today \u2014 to say while I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign,\" she said.\nThe vice president pledged to continue fighting for democracy, the rule of law and equal justice.\n\"Sometimes the fight takes a while. That doesn't mean we won't win,\" she said, delivering an appeal directly to her young supporters.\nHarris continued, \"Do not despair. This is not a time to throw up our hands. This is a time to roll up our sleeves. This is a time to organize, to mobilize and to stay engaged for the sake of freedom and justice and the future that we all know we can build together.\"\nThe vice president's speech came just hours after she called Trump to congratulate him on his win and discussed the \"importance of a peaceful transfer of power and being a president for all Americans,\" a senior aide to Harris said. The vice president, in her role as president of the Senate, will preside over Congress' counting of electoral votes during a joint session on Jan. 6 that will reaffirm Trump's victory.\nCBS News projected Wednesday that Harris had secured 222 electoral votes, short of the 291 amassed by Trump, her Republican opponent. Trump surpassed the 270 electoral votes needed to secure the presidency just after 5:30 a.m. ET Wednesday, after locking up the battleground states of Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan\u00a0and Wisconsin.\nThe vice president called Trump to congratulate him on his win and discussed the \"importance of a peaceful transfer of power and being a president for all Americans,\" a senior aide to Harris said. The vice president, in her role as president of the Senate, will preside over Congress' counting of electoral votes during a joint session on Jan. 6 that will reaffirm Trump's victory.\nSteven Cheung, spokesman for the Trump campaign, said that during the call, the president-elect \"acknowledged Vice President Harris on her strength, professionalism, and tenacity throughout the campaign, and both leaders agreed on the importance of unifying the country.\"\nMr. Biden also spoke with Harris by phone and congratulated her on a \"historic campaign,\" the White House said. He also talked to Trump and \"expressed his commitment to ensuring a smooth transition and emphasized the importance of working to bring the country together.\"\nHarris was expected to address supporters from Howard, the historically Black college where she graduated in 1986, on election night, but never made it to her alma mater as the results came rolling in. Instead, campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond sent the assembled crowd home and said Harris would speak on Wednesday.\nElection Day on Nov. 5 capped a chaotic and historic presidential election cycle that saw two assassination attempts against Trump and was roiled by Mr. Biden's sudden announcement in July that he would exit the race following a disastrous debate performance in late June.\nHarris swiftly announced her own candidacy for the White House, and Democrats quickly coalesced around her as their pick to take on Trump. Her nomination was solidified at the Democratic National Committee in Chicago in August, where Harris made history as the first woman of color to top a major party ticket.\nMelissa Quinn is a politics reporter for CBSNews.com.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\nFollow AP\u2019s coverage of Donald Trump\u2019s transition back to the White House.\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump won his sixth battleground state of the 2024 election early Saturday, beating Vice President Kamala Harris in Nevada.\nThe Associated Press declared Trump the winner after concluding there were not enough uncounted ballots in the state\u2019s strongest Democratic areas to overcome the former president\u2019s 46,000-vote lead over the Democratic nominee.\nTrump clinched a second term early Wednesday when Wisconsin pushed him past the 270 electoral votes needed to win, so Nevada\u2019s six electoral votes only added to the size of his victory: He now has 301 electoral votes and has won six of the seven battleground states. Only Arizona remains to be called.\nThe AP only declares a winner once it can determine that a trailing candidate can\u2019t close the gap and overtake the vote leader.\nHere\u2019s a look at how the AP called this race:\nCANDIDATES: Harris (D) vs. Trump (R) vs. Chase Oliver (Libertarian) vs. Joel Skousen (Independent American Party) vs. \u201cNone of these candidates.\u201d\nWINNER: Trump.\nPOLL CLOSING TIME: 10 p.m. ET\nABOUT THE RACE:\nNevada has one of the nation\u2019s best overall track records as a presidential bellwether, although voters there supported Democrat Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016. The state remains a hotly contested battleground. Both Harris and Trump made frequent visits to Nevada since becoming their parties\u2019 nominees, including Halloween rallies in Clark County, home of Henderson and Las Vegas. Both campaigns concentrated their visit to those two cities, as well as Reno in Washoe County.\nWhat to know about the 2024 election:\nNews outlets globally count on the AP for accurate U.S. election results. Since 1848, the AP has been calling races up and down the ballot. Support us. Donate to the AP.\nIn statewide elections, Democrats tend to carry only two of Nevada\u2019s 17 counties: Clark and Washoe. Whether they win depends on how big their margins are in those two counties. Clark County has by far the largest population in the state. A large vote margin there is vital to Democratic electoral success. It comprised 69% of the total statewide vote in 2020. Washoe is more competitive, although Democrats have consistently prevailed there in high-profile statewide campaigns, including Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak\u2019s unsuccessful 2022 reelection bid. Republicans tend to win the rest of the state by wide margins.\n\n\nWHY AP CALLED THE RACE:\nMost of the final ballots to be counted come from Clark and Washoe counties. They both have long-established histories of supporting Democrats for president. Statewide, votes counted after Election Day have also tended to favor Democrats. \nTrump\u2019s vote lead narrowed as more of these ballots are counted over the course of the week, but Harris was not winning those ballots by a large enough margin to overtake Trump for the lead. At the time AP called the race, AP estimated Harris would need to win 85% of all ballots left to count \u2014 a margin of victory she never achieved in any update since polls closed. \n___\nLearn more about how and why the AP declares winners in U.S. elections at Explaining Election 2024, a series from The Associated Press aimed at helping make sense of the American democracy.

    "content": "House Democrats returned to the Capitol on Tuesday, dejected and licking their wounds after an election drubbing a week earlier that will put Donald Trump back in the White House and Republicans in control of all the levers of power in Washington next year. While Democrats in the lower chamber outperformed Vice President Harris at the polls — a dynamic that will leave Republicans with another razor-thin majority in the 119th Congress — that moral victory was a dim consolation for a party that had hinged its campaign on warnings that Trump posed a material threat to America’s foundational democratic traditions. Faced with Trump’s runaway victory for a second term in the White House, Democrats are now in the early stages of a post-mortem reckoning about what went wrong and how to turn the ship around — a somber discussion that’s already featured plenty of finger-pointing about where the blame should fall. “It’s catastrophic,” said Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), a 30-year veteran of the House who was the first Democratic lawmaker to call on President Biden to step aside. “There have been other challenges in the past, but this is certainly the greatest one of my political life.” House Democrats lost a number of members who won’t be returning next year. Many of those are retirements, and some are lawmakers who ran — and won — races for higher office. But others were defeated at the polls last week, including two veteran Pennsylvania lawmakers — Reps. Matt Cartwright and Susan Wild — who had 20 years of experience between them. Assembled on the House floor Tuesday night, Democrats of all stripes lined up to comfort their vanquished friends — a biennial ritual that felt even more momentous this year because of Trump’s imminent return to the White House. Wild — a six-year veteran of the House who lost re-election by one percentage point last week — received a hug from Rep. Lori Trahan (Mass.) on the floor. House Minority Whip Katherine Clark (Mass.) embraced Rep. Colin Allred (Texas), who lost his bid for Senate last week. And Rep. Kathy Manning (N.C.) was seen hugging Rep. Mary Peltola (Alaska), who is currently trailing in her contest. There were, to be sure, some bright spots for the Democrats this cycle that revealed themselves on the floor. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (Del.), Delaware’s senator-elect, was taking photos with a bouquet of flowers on the floor. Rep. Dean Philips (Minn.) gave a congratulatory high-five to Rep. Elissa Slotkin (Mich.), who won a tough contest to become Michigan’s junior senator. And Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.) hugged Rep. Adam Schiff (Calif.), who won his race to fill an open California Senate seat. Still, Democrats have been devastated by Trump’s victory. And Tuesday’s scene in the Capitol bore some echoes of Congress’s return to Washington in late 2016, after Trump stunned the country by defeating Hillary Clinton to win his first turn in the Oval Office. Then, as now, Democrats were ready to celebrate the first female president in the country’s history. And then, as now, Trump dashed those plans when voters flocked to his “America First” message of populist nationalism. This time around, Democrats thought they had an additional advantage because of Trump’s legal woes, which include 34 felony convictions since he left office. This year was also the first presidential race since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, which led directly to Trump’s second impeachment.  Instead of celebrating a big win, however, Democrats were left to analyze how Trump — despite all the baggage — was able to convince voters that he was the better candidate. “It is healthy for us to have this conversation,” said Rep. Adam Smith (Wash.). “I know a lot of people [say], ‘Well, let’s not be critical.’ No, no. … I believe in after-action reports.” Many Democrats have pointed fingers at Biden, whose disastrous debate against Trump in June had prompted other party leaders to convince him not to seek a second term. Some now say Biden and his team should have recognized his limitations earlier, and not sought reelection at all. “That’s the only scenario I can think of where we might have had a chance, is if Biden had just never run for reelection,” said Rep. Jared Huffman (Calif.). “The White House did a pretty good job of keeping up appearances and concealing the problem. And it’s a shame, it’s a terrible shame that there wasn’t more self-awareness there. “Ego, ambition, these other human qualities are powerful factors.” Smith, who was among the first Democrats to call for Biden to drop off the ballot, agreed, saying the president’s long delay in making that decision left Harris in the difficult position of explaining why she hadn’t sounded the alarm on Biden’s fitness sooner. “He was struggling for months there, and a lot of people asked Vice President Harris, ‘Well, you saw him struggling, did you think that was OK?’ It put her in a very, very bad position,” he said. Some, however, put the onus on themselves for not calling on Biden to call it quits sooner. “I only regret I didn’t do it earlier,” Doggett said of urging Biden to step aside. “I think it’s unfortunate that he took three weeks to decide.” “I believe that the only person in our caucus who doesn’t share some responsibility for the outcome is Dean Phillips, who came out early,” he continued, referencing the Minnesota Democrat who mounted a failed primary challenge to Biden. “I accept responsibility as well that there’s more that we could have done.” With hopes of clinching control of the House gone, Republicans set to take the reins in the Senate, and Trump headed back to the White House for four years, House Democrats are looking ahead to the 2026 midterm elections — what they say is their next best hope of putting a check on the GOP’s control in Washington. “It’s gonna be a long four years and we have to take it a day at a time, as I’m doing today,” Doggett said. “But the most important period will be these first two years, that’s when he’ll set the tone of how much of a tyrant he’ll be, and when our pushing back will count for the most.” “But it’s also the two years that leads up to the greatest opportunity for us to have an effective check on him with the midterm elections,” he added."

There were very slight differences between the electronic and hand-counted ballots, which were \u201cwell within the expected margin of error for an audit of this size, and largely caused by human error during the hand counting process.\u201d\nThe state\u2019s certification of the presidential election results follows the county\u2019s certifications on Nov. 12.\nGeorgia had record voter turnout, both in early voting and on Election Day. Of the state\u2019s nearly 7.3 million voters, 5.3 million voted (72.7% turnout) in the general election.\nWith all precincts reporting in the Peach State, Trump received 50.73% of the vote to Harris\u2019 48.53%. Two third-party candidates garnered just 0.74%.\n\u201cThis was the most secure election in Georgia\u2019s history,\u201d Raffensperger said.\nNow, with the election results certified, Rep.

Although many of the 2020 alternate electors said they met only to preserve Republican legal options as they fought the results in court, some Trump allies used their votes to try to persuade Congress to decide the election for him during the joint session on Jan. 6, 2021. That effort became the focus of congressional hearings as well as criminal cases in which electors in four states were accused of an attempted conspiracy to overturn Biden’s victory. Although Trump won the electoral college comfortably this time, and he defeated Harris in the popular vote by more than 2 million votes, his share of the popular vote when third-party candidate totals are included falls slightly below a majority, at 49.9 percent, according to data compiled by the Associated Press. The electoral college is a unique feature of American democracy, which does not choose its president with a direct popular vote. Instead, candidates for president or their parties choose electors — who are activated to convene only if their candidate wins their state — and voters are casting ballots for those electors. In two states, Maine and Nebraska, some electoral votes are awarded by congressional district rather than according to statewide results. Under federal law, the states were required this year to certify their results by Dec. 11, determining which candidate’s electors would convene on the first Tuesday after the second Wednesday of December. Next, electors must transmit certificates of their votes to Washington for the final step in determining the outcome of the election: the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6. States and the federal government alike spent months planning for heightened security around the convening of the electors and the joint session, given the protests surrounding Biden’s victory four years ago in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Several states reported this week that some of the preparations have proved unnecessary with Trump’s win, which Harris did not contest. “To be honest, I forgot about it,” said Gabriel Sterling, a senior aide to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R). “That’s how boring and uneventful it’s going to be.” In Arizona, 11 Republican electors gathered at an undisclosed location to fulfill their duties, citing security concerns, but live-streamed the event for the public to watch. With the U.S. and Arizona flags as a backdrop, the electors took their oath and silently signed the paperwork. Nearby music pulsed during the event, and the electors clapped after they finished their obligations. The lack of drama prompted commentary from Democrats, many of whom have accused Republicans of accepting the results this year only because Trump won. “Funny how when real electors meet, they do so in public. With the press,” Ann Jacobs, the Democratic chair of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, wrote on X. Electors in at least three states this year — Michigan, Nevada and New Mexico — were also Trump electors in 2020 and convened to vote that year despite Trump’s loss in their states. One of those electors in Michigan, Hank Choate, carried a button into the state House chamber Tuesday with the phrase “2020 alternate elector” on it, according to a photo posted to X."
