# Political News Article Keyword Extractor

This project scrapes the full content and publication date of political news articles from a CSV list of article URLs, then uses a custom Ollama agent to extract five salient keywords from each article. The final result is a JSON file mapping article titles to publish dates and keywords.

## Project Structure

`Articles.csv`
- A CSV file containing two columns: article titles and their corresponding URLs.
- This is the starting point of the project.

`scrape_articles.py`
- A Python script that:
  - Loads the URLs from Articles.csv
  - Fetches the article content via HTTP requests
  - Extracts and stores:
      - Title
      - Article content
      - Publishing date (if available)
  - Outputs the results into Article_Contents_Output.json

`Article_Contents_Output.json`
- A JSON file generated by scrape_articles.py
- Each entry contains:
    - title: the article title
    - url: the original URL
    - publish_date: extracted publish date (if available)
    - content: the full scraped article content

`prompt.py`
- A script that:
    - Loads the cleaned article JSON
    - Uses the Ollama agent to:
        - Analyze the article content
        - Generate five keywords that best represent each article
    - Outputs results into Extracted_Keywords.json

`Extracted_Keywords.json`
- A JSON file containing:
    - title: article title
    - idx: article index
    - publish_date: same as from the original article
    - keywords: a list of 5 significant keywords relevant to the article's content
